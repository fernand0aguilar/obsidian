# Design Thinking

At a high level, the steps involved in the design thinking process are simple: 

* first, fully understand the problem; 

* second, explore a wide range of possible solutions; 

* third, iterate extensively through prototyping and testing; 

* and finally, implement through the customary deployment mechanisms.
