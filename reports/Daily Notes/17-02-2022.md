##  What did you do today
Today ive done some of the works that were necessary in order to maintain order and also get the movement going in a way that would be benefitial to the whole universe. Ive done work from 9 to 5 as it is required from now on. I've done my due part in being consciously diligent in my tasks throughout the day, and this means, that i've also been able to perform a great number of activities in the process of transmutating the energy within me to a creative energy that lies outside just at the boundaries of me and the material world. 

##  What Are you Grateful For
I am grateful for being grateful, for waking up with a definite purpose in being aware of what is happening and how to perform better in the environment that I am in. I am grateful for being amongst so many beautiful souls that are also collaborating with me in a process of generating more that we have, in creating more, in increasing life, through a creative process of self discovery.

I am grateful for having these systems in place, for the source energy that I feel, from being amongst so many brilliant people.

I am grateful for the sun that warms my head, for the family, friends and business that i've got, and for all that is yet to happen.
