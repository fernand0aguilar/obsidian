## What did you accomplish today?
Today I've started doing daily notes on obsidian and feel like this is the future of note taking for me to go on.
[[30) Make a daily to do list. Everyday.... Add deadlines, add goals, create systems. Plan your day before it happens and then hold yourself accountable. You have no idea how much you can accomplish in one day until you try.]]


## What are some moments worth sharing?

Today I did a meeting with 2 new guys that we just recently hired and we are now able to finish everything we need for the BlackOcean project.

## ðŸ“– Logs

Today I've started using this as a note taking app. I've been experimenting with many different tools such as Notion and Evernote and find them very useful when it comes to writing. Altho I want to go to the next level in productivity so I might as well start by doing what is necessary. 

I think that I will be making a new entry every day for one month and see what comes out of it.
