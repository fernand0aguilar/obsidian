##  What Are you Grateful For
I'm grateful to be able to commit myself to accomplish everything that ive set myself to accomplish, and then to do more than enough to actually get there. iM GRATEFUL TO BE ABLE TO ATTRACT AND SUSTAIN A GREAT WOMAN INTO MY LIFE, AND TO BE ALWAYS LOOKING FOR WAYS TO IMPROVE WHO I AM AND TO BECOME BETTER THAN I WAS. THIS MAKES ME INTO A STATE OF GRATITUDE BECAUSE I AM VISUALIZING A GOAL FOR MYSELF, AND BY ACHIEVING THINGS IN LIFE, IT IS PROVING THAT I CAN ALSO ACHIEVE MUCH MORE, AND IT ALSO PROVES ME THAT MY HIGHGOAL OF 20 YEARS IS POSSIBLE AND CLOSE BY.
