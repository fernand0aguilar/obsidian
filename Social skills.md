In general, women are irresistibly attracted to fortune, stature and a strong masculine essence. 

## First priority: 

Devote yourself to your fortune; commit to a grand aim and be selfish with it. Make this your greater importance.

Here's a key your father didn't tell you: 

Women are intrigued and drawn to selfish men. 

Men who are driven by greatness, who possess an unreasonable self-confidence, are trophies that women topple over for. 

Combine that with a superior man's charming indifference and lack of neediness, and you have a formula that makes women unavoidably won over. 

The less friendly attention you give her, the more attention she gives and demands.

### Develop these traits: 
* **Uncompromising** - caution yourself with good reason, 
* **Selective Arrogance and Aggression** - know how to swiftly disregard trivialities, escalate physically, and make a bold move.
* **Elusiveness** - don't be predictable, use surprise and unpredictability to your advantage. 
* **Leadership** - lead without inquiry. Take charge without apology.
* **Charm** - use cockiness, wit and humour to your advantage, tease her hard and often and know how to play the game without getting upset. Don't take shit-tests too seriously, you can easily downplay them through loudening their absurdity or ignoring them.

Be stoic with how you handle your emotions, but bold, irrationally self-assured and forbidding when necessary.

If you're an embodiment of these traits, you're an asshole in her portrayal. There are many assholes who care too much and have their game work against them. The disinterested and aloof asshole is the man who turns women into little girls.


### Avoid: 
these always undermine your frame
* compliance, 
* obedience,
* excuse when unnecessary,
* transparency,
* emotional outbursts,
* insecure safeguarding,
* timidity,
* overt uncertainty,
* excessive pity,
* and indulgence,
* unwarranted apologies
* signs of envy or insecurity
* avoid agreeableness
* Don't be a chatter box, be a better listener.
* Avoid overt indecision at all costs
