# Rapid Planning Method (RPM)

RPM planning is a way to maximize the results of your life and maximize your sense of fulfillment and joy. 

What’s most important to you as an outcome (a result) and why it is important to you (your purpose) will give you the juice to move forward toward realizing your dreams. 

If you’ve got a strong enough reason and a strong enough purpose, you will figure out how to pull it off.

 * Results-oriented - know what you want
 
 * Purpose-driven - why you want it
 
 * Massive Action Plan - Plan for how to get it

The sequence is critical, in that order, your actions will be sustainable through life’s challenges, and you’ll have possibility of experiencing what it is you truly desire.
