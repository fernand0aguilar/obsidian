[[ Situational Awareness]]1

**Stop to observe everything around you.**

Take a few moments every day, and just pause. Sweep your gaze over your field of vision.

Try to notice as many details as possible. This will train you to pay more attention to your surroundings.

**Pay attention to small details.** 

Often, people only notice the large objects that surround them.


**Stay in the present moment.** 

It is easy to become distracted by electronics, intrusive thoughts, or noisy environments, but these can make you less observant.

Rather than tune out your surroundings, try to focus on where you are in the moment.


**Write down everything that you notice on a daily basis.**

Do this throughout your day as you notice things. This will keep you observant in the moment. Write your observations in a journal or word document. Try to be as specific as possible.

**Quantify everything you notice.** 

When you're trying to observe something, try to identify how many of them there are. These numbers will force to you to pay more attention to the size or quantity of objects. 
As time goes on, you may be able to count objects more quickly

**Recall details after looking at a piece of art.** 

Go to an art museum or find an online collection. Pick one piece of art that catches your eye. Study it for 60 seconds, then look away. From memory, try to recall as many details as possible about the picture.

-   Try to describe the small, background details as well as the subject of the piece. For example, if it is a portrait, try to recall what the person is wearing, the room they are in, and any other objects around them.
-   If the piece is a large landscape, you should try to remember where geographical features are. Are there trees in the picture? If so, which side of the painting were they on? Are they above or below something else?
-   The Metropolitan Museum has a great collection of art online that you can use for this exercise: [http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection](http://www.metmuseum.org/art/collection).

**Practice mindfulness meditation daily.** 

Sit in a quiet, comfortable space. Close your eyes. Focus your attention on your breath. Don't daydream or think about your life. 

Instead, hone in on the sensations around you. What do you hear, feel, and smell? 

Start with five minutes, and work your way up to twenty minutes of meditation a day.

-   If you start losing your train of thought, it's OK. Just steer your concentration back to your breath.
-   You may only be able to meditate for a few minutes at first, but you will get better over time.

**Identify any strange sounds or smells.** 

Instead of ignoring new sounds and smells, try to guess what it is. If possible, investigate the source to see if you were right or not.

-   For example, if you smell something cooking, guess what food it is. Does it smell like meat, spices, or baked goods? Is it close to you or faint and faraway?
-   If you hear a knocking noise, evaluate your surroundings. Is it coming from a certain wall? Is it a consistent patter or an erratic beat? What might someone be doing to make that noise?

**Slow down as you eat your food to savor it.**

As you eat, try to identify all of the different sensations in your mouth. 

To do this, chew and taste your food for a few seconds before swallowing. Pause for two or three seconds between each bite. Ask yourself:

-   What different flavors do I notice?
-   Do the flavors change as I chew?
-   What is the texture like?
-   Does this food leave a particular aftertaste?


**Feel objects with your eyes closed to improve your sense of touch.** 

Ask a friend or family member to stick a few objects into a pillow case.

Close your eyes, and pick one object at random.

Using only your hands, try to guess what the object is. Ask yourself:
-   What is the texture of the object? Is it smooth, bumpy, ridged, or soft?
-   Does it feel hot, cold, or neither?
-   What shape is it?
-   Does it open? Is there a button or other moveable part on it?
-   When you shake it, do you feel something rattling inside?
-   Does it make a noise?
