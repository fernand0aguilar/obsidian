Here are some things to think about.

These are ideas, not rules. 

Ideas to help you think about making your current process, what ever it is, a more Agile process.

## Iterative Planning

- The best way to meet customer objectives is to explicitly schedule their completion.

- Trying to catch up is the fastest way to get further behind.

- The changes you get late in a project are very valuable because you paid the most to get them.

- One third of your requirements will represent two thirds of the project's value.

- Showing someone something they can change is helpful, showing something they can't change is spiteful.

- Iterative development gives you a few "oh drat"s during development instead of one big "AW SHIT" at the end.

## Honest Plans

- An estimate not based on a measurement is a guess; an estimate based on a measurement is a prediction.

- He who does the work sets the estimate.

- If software is what you want to deliver then measure progress by how much you have working right now.

## Team Empowerment
- The most important thing on a project is good leadership; the least important thing is who leads.

- If you can see a need for leadership you know enough to lead.

- When you only have responsibility you will know worry, but when you also have authority you will know opportunity.

- The organization of your team will be reflected in the code. (Conway's Law)

- Calm and relaxed plus confident yields decisive.

- Count how many people are on the project, now communicate like a group that size.

- Hermits donâ€™t share, communities are based on sharing.

## Developers /Team Members

- Big changes cause big problems.

- Egoless programming doesn't work; expand your ego to include everyone's code.

- Don't guess, measure it.

- Don't theorize, try it.

- Everything you did today can be done over tomorrow in half an hour and be better.

- Measure twice cut once saves wood, but software isn't made of wood.

- The best way to get help is to offer help.

## Testing
- The first test is the hardest.

- Your test suite is more valuable than your code

- The harder the test is to create the greater your savings.

- Where there is a will there is a way to test.

- If you want a good suite of tests next year you must start collecting them today.

## Process

- If you don't use your process it can't help you; if your process doesn't help, you won't use it.

- The one essential ingredient that turns repetitive development into iterative development is feedback.

- If less doesn't work try more, if more doesn't work try less, if neither works stop doing it.

- If 10 people slow the project down by just 10% each it will take twice as long.

- If it isn't fun you're doing something wrong.

- A hammer without a good process is a sore thumb waiting to happen.

- Process is something you do, not something you do to someone.

- The person least likely to save time is the person in the biggest hurry.

- The least disciplined team member has the greatest control over your process.


## Simplicity

- Simple is subjective so judge it subjectively as testable, browsable, understandable, and explainable.

- The best way to guarantee it costs too much is to add something you don't need.

- If it takes you too long to refactor than you are not refactoring enough.

- A simple solution always takes less time than a complex one.

- If you always try the simplest thing next you will always work as simply as you can.

## Design
- Who ever finds a problem knows enough to design a solution.

- Flexibility isn't building for every imaginable possibility; it's having as little to change as possible.

- A good design can be explained to someone else using four blank cards.

- A design which doesn't meet business needs is bad, no matter how pretty.

- UML was designed to document complexity, not expose it.

## Documentation /Models

- Agile models are paintings, not photographs.

- The creation of a document is an implicit agreement to keep it up to date or destroy it.

- Without the use they are just cases.

- Ideas move faster than documents.


## Managers /Scrum Masters

- Challenge your team intellectually or they will challenge themselves in ways you wouldn't have chosen.

- Demanding estimates change seems like taking control, but you lose control by not making a decision.

- People don't scale, teams do.

- The only way to guarantee bad decisions is to make all of them yourself.
