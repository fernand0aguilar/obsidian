## Benefits of using a work breakdown structure

The work breakdown structure offers several benefits. Aside from organizing the work on a project, some of the benefits of a WBS are:

-   **Improved efficiency:** By dividing the project into smaller components and defining the outcomes, it’s easier to make progress because the steps required for project completion are outlined and the team knows what’s expected of them, resulting in greater efficiency.
-   **Realistic timelines:** Because all required tasks are cataloged, a project completion timeline can be more accurately calculated. This helps the team avoid unrealistic deadlines and identifies the tasks that can be done in parallel.
-   **Easier progress tracking:** The WBS simplifies tracking project progress. As each component is completed, it’s straightforward to compare what’s done with the work left to do. For example, if a project is broken down into 10 tasks and 4 are completed, it’s clear to see that 60% of the project remains.

### Step 1: List out all of the project tasks
Identify and map it using a WBS diagram

### Step 2: Establish task dependencies
This chart will help you map out the critical path for completing a project, as well as show the additional non-critical steps you’ll have to take. However, before we determine the critical path, we have to establish the duration of these tasks.

### Step 3: Determine the duration of each of these tasks
measure the time in minutes and calculated out the duration of each path

### Step 4: Identify the critical path
 As we established before, the critical path of a project is the measurement of the duration of the project, so this means that the longest path in the chart will be our critical path.
