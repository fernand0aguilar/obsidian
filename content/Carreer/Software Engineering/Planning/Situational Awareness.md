# Situational awareness

But it’s also a skill that can and should be developed for reasons outside of personal defense and safety.

Situational awareness is really just another word for mindfulness,

and developing mine has made me more cognizant of what’s going on around me and 

in my daily activities, which in turn has helped me make better decisions in all aspects of my life.

And how should we orient ourselves so that we observe the right things and understand the context for what we’re seeing?
