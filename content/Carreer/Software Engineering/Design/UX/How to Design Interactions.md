# How to [[Design]] Interactions

## Life Cycles

There's a conceptual project, an implementation process, and a lot more artifacts.

A conceptual project is one where we have the intent of projecting with ideas and presenting what is, or how is the project going to be.

* Know the user
* Make a competitisve analysis
* Define the usability metrics
* Make parallel designs
* Adopt a shared design (participative)
* Make coordinate interface designs as a whole 
* Apply different reference lines and heuristic analysis
* Make prototypes
* Make empirical test
* Practice interactive design
* Make an user evaluation 

The conceptual project is mostly documents, skipping the phase of implementation. Where as in the prototype phase we are focused on building an initial version.


The difference between the current situation and the desired situation is the main motivation for projecting an synthesizing an **intervention**

Frequently an intervention is denominated solution. Because it answers the question that defines a problem to be solved. 

## How can I enhance this situation??
[[CRC Model]]

In some cases it requires only a change in the process, without changing the used systems.

When the intervention is about developing systems, we must articulate the interest of all stakeholders with 
1. gathered knowledge in the analysis of the initial situation. 
2. Knowledge about good or bad evaluated interventions
3. knowledge about possibilities and limitations of the available technologies.

# Interactions

Interaction is a process of action from the agent with something,or someone.
It is usually an active process. But interaction can also be a passive process.

Associated with a pair of cause and effect. 
Has multiple phases and generally hits a defined result.

Interaction is a kind of action that occur as two or more objects have an effect upon one another. The idea of a two-way effect is essential in the concept of interaction, as opposed to a one-way causal effect.
