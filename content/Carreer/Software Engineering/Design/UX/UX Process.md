### User Experience Plan

The first step is the process of knowing the universe of information in which the system is inserted.

This is probably the main obstacle for the team, since most members do not have direct contact with the problem. 

One of the techniques to be used to clarify aspects of the domain is the [[Empathy Map]], which maps the needs and pains of the customers to be satisfied with the application that will be developed.

In order to elicit the functional requirements, the main technique to be used by the team is Brainstorming. 

The same will happen in three different ways: 

With the client, in order to gather evidence of a good solution that meets their wishes;

With the Product Engineering team, in order to learn about solutions from a product point of view and new ideas that meet the needs of stakeholders and;

With the Software Development team, in order to align the team with the purposes and refine the requirements already obtained.

In addition, it is intended to carry out the requirements survey through observation by introspection, observing and collecting information from the existing application. 

The next step to be carried out consists of prioritizing the requirements obtained with the application of the techniques reported above, for this it is intended, a priori, to use an equivalence to MoSCoW. However, the categories will only encompass 3 levels of prioritization, namely: Must have, Could have and Would Have, being equivalent, respectively, to: Low, medium and high priority. 

It should be noted that this step is essential to support the development process, as it guides in choosing which requirements should be developed first. In a way, at this point, a greater definition of the scope of the project is obtained.

Although usability testing is not exactly a technique for eliciting new requirements, it is also possible that during the test it is possible to discover new requirements, since the objective is to test the flow of experience.
