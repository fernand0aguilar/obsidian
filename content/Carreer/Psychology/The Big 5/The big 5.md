# Big5 Traits
Everybody's personality is composed of two higher-order traits. 

The first higher-order trait is known as plasticity, and can be thought of as the tendency to be: 
* flexible, 
* exploratory,
* curious,
* and quick to adapt. 

The second higher-order trait is known as stability, and can be thought of as the tendency to be:
* structured,
* organized,
* emotionally stable 
* and focused.

## Plasticity

Plasticity, the first higher-order trait, can be further broken down into two sub-traits:

[[Extraversion]] (the tendency to be enthusiastic and dominant) 

and [[Openness]] (the tendency to be open-minded and intelligent).

## Stability

Stability, the second higher-order trait, can be further broken down into three sub-traits: 

[[Conscientiousness]] (the tendency to be orderly and industrious), Emotional Stability 

[[Neuroticism]] (lack of negative emotional volatility and the tendency to withdraw), and 

[[Agreeableness]] (politeness and compassion, as opposed to belligerence or aggression).

There are advantages and disadvantages to each trait, particularly at the extremes.

Extremely sociable, extraverted people can be dominant and impulsive, while introverted, quiet people can easily become isolated and depressed.

Extremely open people can be scattered and overwhelmed by their own thoughts and ideas, while closed-minded people may become narrow and inflexible. 

Exceptionally conscientious people can be obsessive about order, judgemental and rigid, while their more carefree counterparts may be messy, undisciplined and careless.

People very high in emotional stability may engage in risky, dangerous behavior, while those who are more neurotic can become so preoccupied by anxiety and pain that they are unable to function.

Finally, extremely agreeable people may never stand up for themselves, while those who are too assertive can be aggressive, callous and bullying.


## Personality Change
As people age, for example, they tend to become more agreeable, conscientious and emotionally stable.

Changing personality means changing habits of action, presumption and perception. 

Personality change requires the formulation of clear future goals, as well as discipline and practice.

People who are too agreeable can learn to stand up for themselves.Disorderly people can become more conscientious. Introverted people can become socially skilled. People who experience paralyzing levels of negative emotion can learn to explore.
