Zen - by Allan Watts


[[Zen]] is the Japanese equivalent for Dhyana, which “represents human effort to reach through meditation zones of thought beyond the range of verbal expression.”

* Its method is contemplation, convinced of a principle that underlies all phenomena, and putting oneself in harmony with the Absolute. 
* Whoever attains to the perception of the Absolute raises himself above mundane things and awakes, “to a new Heaven and a new Earth.”
