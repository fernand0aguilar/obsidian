# 5 steps

## Step 1: 

**Get Clear on What You Want (and Why You Want To Manifest it Into Your Life).**

 [[What do you want]]

Why You Want It

## Step 2: 
**Visualize It**

As you get ready to visualize your desire, engage all of your 5 senses of
sight, hearing, taste, touch and smell to describe it...

1. What does it look like?
2. What does it smell like?
3. What does it sound like?
4. What does it feel like?
5. What does it taste like?


## Step 3: 
**Feel Now**

The vibration of gratefulness and appreciation are both very high, so
the more that you can feel that feeling, the better...

In the space below, write down a list of everything that you are
grateful for.

```
I am grateful for...
```



## Step 4: 
**Allow**

In the space below, write down a list of fun and joyful activities that
allow you to let loose and surrender to the power of the universe. For
example, taking a bath, going on a picnic, or going on a trip out of
town. What types of things inspire you?

```
I am inspired by...
```

## Step 5: 
**Receive,  overcome**

In the space below, write down what your obstacles are in the left
column, and how you will overcome them on the right...

```
My Obstacles How I Will Overcome
```

## Optional Step

**Ordering Personal Check**

**Instructions:**

Before you fill out your check, get yourself into a good feeling
place first.

The best way to do this is to listen to the “10 Minute Meditator” Theta
audio, then visualize receiving the amount of money that you want.

How does it make you feel? Once you get that feeling, then proceed
with the following:

**1.** Fill out your name.

**2.** Fill out the amount including writing it out long-hand.

**3.** Post-date the check for when you believe it will come by.

**4.** Sign it.

**5.** Put it in your wallet or purse and carry it with you everywhere
you go.

**6.** When you feel like it, pull the check out, look at it and milk the
feeling.
