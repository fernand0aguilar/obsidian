### Security in the Modern Organization

Security is increasingly critical in today’s digital-first world. With personal data stored by third parties, breaches have become common, highlighting the need for robust security measures. The complexity of modern systems, as explained by complexity theory and the Cynefin framework, requires quick reactions to vulnerabilities rather than slow, exhaustive assessments. Businesses must balance the need for agility with security demands, as breaches can cause reputational damage, legal liabilities, and financial losses.

Cloud infrastructure has become ubiquitous, prompting governments to enhance regulations like GDPR and CCPA. Security principles remain valid but must adapt to the cloud environment, emphasizing cloud native security. This involves leveraging technology designed for cloud adoption, characterized by automation, scalability, and support for serverless and containerized workloads.

Cloud native security capitalizes on the cloud’s advantages: pay-per-use, economies of scale, no capacity planning, and enhanced speed and agility. This approach allows businesses to focus on core competencies while CSPs handle infrastructure.

Security's role in organizations has shifted from gatekeeping to enabling. Traditional siloed security models, like those in change advisory boards, are incompatible with fast-paced digital environments. Instead, security should operate as an enablement team, collaborating with other teams to embed security competencies.

The purpose of modern security is risk management, not achieving perfect security. Companies aim to minimize security incidents through commercially reasonable efforts, which vary by context. Startups may tolerate higher risks than regulated enterprises, but with proper principles, both can maintain agility.

DevSecOps extends DevOps principles to security, integrating security objectives without hindering team performance. DevOps emphasizes cultural transformation, merging development and operations for rapid, reliable software delivery. Elite DevOps teams deploy code frequently and recover quickly from incidents, setting a precedent for DevSecOps.

Key principles from DevOps, like the Three Ways and the Five Ideals, underpin DevSecOps. The Three Ways focus on system optimization, feedback loops, and continual learning, while the Five Ideals promote team autonomy, flow, and joy in work. These principles drive the cultural and engineering shifts necessary for effective security in modern organizations.

In summary, the integration of security into the agile, cloud-driven environment is essential. By embracing cloud native security and DevSecOps, organizations can protect their assets while maintaining the speed and flexibility needed in the digital age.



The rush for features often leads to technical debt, necessitating mindful strategies to manage and reduce it. Systems may need decommissioning or scaling, and decisions can become suboptimal over time. Psychological safety is crucial for high-performing teams, allowing mistakes to become learning opportunities. Systems are categorized as core or context, with security typically being context to support core functions.

**DevSecOps** integrates security into DevOps, emphasizing cultural shifts alongside people, process, and tool changes. It's about managing risk by ensuring changes don't introduce significant vulnerabilities. Smaller, frequent changes reduce risk, and quick lead times for fixes minimize exposure. Continuous integration (CI) and continuous delivery (CD) are foundational to DevOps, enabling frequent, reliable deployments. CI involves regular testing against a base branch, while CD maintains code in a deployable state, making releases a business decision. Continuous deployment automates releases, requiring mature DevSecOps tooling.

**CI/CD Pipelines** are essential for embedding security practices, automating checks like dependency and static code analysis. They serve as information radiators, providing metrics to measure security impact. Key metrics include time to notify and fix vulnerabilities, service impacts, attempted breaches prevented, compliance statistics, and percentage of changes rejected for security reasons.

**Security Principles** include least privilege, defense in depth, and the understanding that security is only as strong as the weakest link. Security should be foundational ("Job Zero") and built into systems from the start. Quality and security must be prioritized from day one to avoid costly technical debt.

Cloud-native security requires fit-for-purpose processes, tools, and a comprehensive understanding of modern threats. Security functions as an enabler rather than a gatekeeper, adapting to sophisticated attacks with robust defenses.



The text focuses on managing risk in modern organizations through DevSecOps and cloud-native security strategies. DevSecOps is a cultural shift integrating security with delivery teams, emphasizing smaller, frequent changes to minimize risk. Security principles like least privilege and defense in depth remain unchanged, but their application has evolved. Key metrics for assessing security maturity include compliant infrastructure percentage, issue resolution speed, and breach prevention.

In cloud environments, a scalable, programmatic approach to account and user setup is essential. For Google Cloud Platform (GCP), organizations should use a hierarchical structure with core folders: Bootstrap, Common, Production, NonProduction, and Development. Each folder serves specific functions, such as centralizing resources or managing production workloads. Terraform scripts are used to automate the deployment of these structures.

AWS employs a similar hierarchical structure with organizations, organizational units (OUs), and accounts. Recommended OUs include Security, Workload, Infrastructure, and additional ones like Exceptions and Transitional for specific needs. AWS accounts are categorized into Production, Preproduction, Development, and Shared, each serving distinct purposes, from hosting production resources to facilitating developer experimentation.

The text also explores strategies for migrating projects between cloud organizations, such as using Import and Export folders or leveraging Cloud Asset Inventory to plan migrations. Maintaining multiple organizations can be costly, so convergence strategies are discussed, including migrating projects or upgrading existing foundations.

Overall, the text provides a comprehensive guide to setting up secure, scalable cloud environments, emphasizing the importance of organizational structure and automation in managing cloud resources effectively.



In AWS and Azure, managing account and subscription structures is crucial for efficient cloud operations. AWS accounts are categorized into types such as production, preproduction, development, and shared. The production account is strictly controlled, with changes made via infrastructure as code (IaC) and CI/CD pipelines. Preproduction mirrors production for testing, while development allows direct developer access for rapid iteration. Shared accounts hold infrastructure like DNS and artifact repositories, with changes managed through IaC.

Organizations can be restructured by migrating accounts or workloads, upgrading existing setups for feature parity, or maintaining multiple organizations temporarily. AWS organizational units (OUs) group accounts, with recommended core units being Security, Workloads, and Infrastructure. Testing organization structure changes in a preproduction mirror of the production setup is advised.

Azure uses a hierarchy of management groups, subscriptions, and resource groups. Core management groups include Sandbox for experimentation, Platform for shared services, Decommissioned for retiring subscriptions, and Landing Zones for team onboarding. Azure subscriptions are units of management and billing, segmented into production, preproduction, development, and shared environments. Policies can be applied at the management group or subscription level for governance, allowing flexibility as teams move to the cloud.

Region locking is a method to restrict resource deployment to specific regions for data sovereignty and security. On GCP, organization policies enforce region locking, inherited down the hierarchy but can be overridden. AWS uses Service Control Policies (SCPs) to implement region locking, with exemptions for global services or those with regional control plane dependencies. SCPs don't apply to the management account, highlighting the need to minimize infrastructure there. Exemption lists for AWS services are updated in SCP documentation, and conditions can be added to allow specific roles broader access for incident response.

Overall, both AWS and Azure offer structured approaches to manage cloud resources efficiently, ensuring governance, security, and flexibility as organizational needs evolve.

In Azure, network security groups (NSGs) are vital for managing traffic. By default, NSGs allow VNet and load balancer traffic for ingress, and VNet and internet traffic for egress, blocking all else. Specific rules can be added to subnets; for instance, allowing all traffic in a public subnet while blocking it in private subnets. Internal subnets can route internet-bound traffic to a black hole, whereas public and private subnets route via a firewall, which blocks all outbound traffic by default.

Azure's Network Watcher, a network monitoring service, captures flow logs and diagnoses connectivity issues. It's deployed per region and subscription, independent of the virtual network. Terraform can automate the creation of Network Watcher and associated resources like Log Analytics workspaces for collecting flow logs.

Virtual Networks (VNets) are the foundational networking construct in Azure, which can be divided into subnets, each with its own NSG and route table. Internet-bound traffic should route through an Azure Firewall, and Network Watcher should be used for monitoring and debugging network issues.

In Google Cloud, Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) secures SSH access, using IAM for authentication and authorization. Engineers can connect privately to instances using SSH over IAP, which abstracts the complexity of key management. Terraform can automate deploying Compute Engine instances with IAP SSH access, enabling secure connections to internal resources like databases.

AWS Systems Manager provides a way to access EC2 instances without direct internet access. VPC endpoints allow private instances to communicate with AWS APIs. Terraform can deploy an EC2 instance with the necessary IAM roles and security groups to enable Session Manager access. This setup also supports tunneling to databases, enhancing security and operational efficiency.

Azure Bastion hosts facilitate secure SSH and RDP access through the Azure Portal. Terraform can automate the deployment of a Bastion host, requiring a specific subnet and public IP. Application Security Groups can be used for identity-based connectivity, simplifying network security management.

In summary, secure networking across Azure, GCP, and AWS involves using built-in services like Azure Firewall, Network Watcher, GCP IAP, and AWS Systems Manager.

When moving Azure resources between resource groups or subscriptions, classify them as stateless (e.g., Azure Functions) or stateful (e.g., databases). Stateless resources can be recreated using Infrastructure as Code (IAC), while stateful resources may require migration. The process involves migrating resources outside Terraform, re-importing them, updating Terraform configurations, and running `terraform plan` to confirm no changes. Use `az resource invoke-action --action validateMoveResources` to validate resource movements. Azure's Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC) is in preview, limited to storage blobs.

### GCP Application Security Scanning

For security testing on GCP, deploy applications in App Engine and use the Web Security Scanner. Managed scans are part of the Security Command Center Premium Tier, running weekly with GET requests to detect vulnerabilities. Custom scans, available to all GCP users, are more invasive and should initially target non-production systems. Configure scans to authenticate with applications and use known IP ranges for traffic predictability. Scans report findings to the Security Command Center, and integration with CI/CD pipelines ensures high-severity issues are addressed.

### AWS Application Security Scanning

AWS lacks a managed security scanning tool, so use CodeBuild to run the OWASP ZAP container. This setup can be integrated into CI/CD pipelines for automated security testing. Logs store test results, which can be preserved in S3 by creating a bucket and attaching an access policy. The CodeBuild project runs the OWASP container, generating reports that are uploaded to S3, ensuring persistent access to scan results.

### Azure Application Security Scanning

Azure also lacks a managed scanning tool, but you can use Azure Container Instances to run the OWASP ZAP container. To save scan reports, mount an Azure storage account share in the container. Integrate scanning into CI/CD pipelines to prevent deploying vulnerable applications. For ad-hoc scans, delete and recreate the container instance using `terraform destroy -target azurerm_container_group.zap`.

### Security in the Future

Cloud-native tools offer rapid innovation and lower total cost of ownership (TCO), enabling better security postures by reallocating resources to higher-order initiatives. Managed services reduce maintenance overhead and provide contractual service-level agreements. Security is an infinite game focused on preventing breaches and enabling secure business operations. Zero Trust models, emphasizing identity over network location for access, are gaining traction.




### Cloud Security and Zero Trust

Cloud-native security emphasizes a zero trust model, as demonstrated by Google's BeyondCorp. This approach ensures security by verifying every request, regardless of its origin. Supply chain security has gained attention due to incidents like the SolarWinds breach. Google's Supply Chain Levels for Software Artifacts (SLSA) framework ensures software integrity by building from known safe components.

### Building Security Capability

Security capability is built through knowledge, skills, and operational capability. Knowledge involves understanding services like KMS and IAM, while skills require hands-on experience with tools like Terraform. Operational capabilities include responding to threats and performing forensic analysis. Simulating threats through game days enhances capability in a safe environment, fostering a culture where security is prioritized.

### Situational Awareness

Wardley Mapping aids in aligning technologies and capabilities to their evolutionary stages, helping identify misalignments and opportunities. This tool supports planning and decision-making by providing a clear view of the current landscape and future steps. Mapping, combined with a customer-centric approach, aligns security efforts with business needs.

### Cloud Native Security

Cloud-native security requires leveraging automation and cloud-native tools to maintain and improve security posture. Evaluating tools by their total cost of ownership allows teams to focus on higher-level concerns. As new services emerge, mindful training and strategic planning enable adaptation to future security challenges.

### Terraform Primer

Terraform, by HashiCorp, is an open-source infrastructure-as-code tool that facilitates multicloud environments. It uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL) to define infrastructure declaratively. The Terraform workflow involves defining variables, initializing providers, planning changes, and applying them. Authentication with providers like GCP, AWS, and Azure is streamlined through CLI tools and service accounts.

### Authentication with Cloud Providers

- **GCP**: Authenticate using `gcloud auth application-default login`.
- **AWS**: Use the AWS CLI tool for authentication.
- **Azure**: Authenticate with `az login`.

### Cloud Provider Security Practices

- **AWS**: Centralize users, lock regions, and utilize scalable account structures. Use AWS Security Hub and GuardDuty for threat detection and compliance.
- **Azure**: Implement scalable subscription structures and centralized user management. Use Azure Security Center and Sentinel for security operations.
- **GCP**: Focus on scalable project structures and centralized user management. Utilize Cloud Security Command Center for threat management.

### Compliance and Security Operations

Compliance as code involves detecting, preventing, and remediating noncompliant infrastructure. Tagging and labeling resources are crucial for compliance. Security operations centers (SOCs) on cloud platforms use integrated tools to centralize logs, detect anomalies, and manage security incidents effectively.

### Networking and Data Handling

Cloud platforms offer solutions for secure networking, including virtual private clouds and secure access to internal resources. Data handling practices emphasize encryption at rest and in transit, with options for using customer-managed keys.

### Conclusion

Cloud-native security is dynamic and requires continuous adaptation to new tools and methodologies. By focusing on capability building, situational awareness, and strategic planning, organizations can maintain robust security postures in evolving cloud environments.
