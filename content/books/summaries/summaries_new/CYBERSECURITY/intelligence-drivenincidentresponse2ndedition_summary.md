The text explores the evolution and significance of intelligence-driven incident response in cybersecurity, emphasizing the integration of cyber threat intelligence into organizational security strategies. It highlights the role of intelligence in decision-making, noting that while decision-makers previously struggled with insufficient information, they now face overwhelming data with persistent ambiguity. Analysts are crucial for synthesizing intelligence and network intrusion knowledge to provide accurate assessments.

The text recounts historical incidents that shaped cybersecurity practices. In 1986, Cliff Stoll discovered unauthorized access at Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, leading to the first documented case of cyberespionage. His work demonstrated the importance of understanding attackers' methods to protect networks and share insights for broader defense strategies.

Another pivotal event was Robert T. Morris's 1988 worm, which unintentionally crashed numerous computers. This incident underscored the need for rapid intrusion identification and attribution, prompting the establishment of the Computer Emergency Response Team (CERT) to address cyberattacks professionally.

The Moonlight Maze intrusion in 1998 further advanced cyber threat intelligence. This long-running attack on US government networks highlighted the necessity of integrating intelligence work with network defense. The incident marked a shift towards recognizing computer networks as integral to intelligence collection and defense.

Modern cyber threat intelligence involves analyzing adversaries' capabilities, motivations, and tactics. It focuses on actionable insights to protect networks, bridging the gap between observations and strategic interpretations. Analysts must convey information meaningfully to aid decision-making, emphasizing the importance of storytelling in presenting data.

The text concludes by acknowledging that while new technologies provide more information about attacker actions, adversaries continually adapt. Effective defense requires structured intelligence work to anticipate and counter evolving threats, ensuring that defenders remain ahead of adversaries.



Intelligence-driven incident response is a structured approach to cybersecurity that integrates threat intelligence into the incident response process. This method involves gathering, analyzing, and applying intelligence to better understand and mitigate cyber threats. The process begins with data collection, which is refined and analyzed to inform decision-making. This intelligence cycle includes direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback, allowing organizations to enhance their security posture and respond effectively to threats.

The concept of intelligence-driven incident response is not new but has evolved to address the complexities of modern cyber threats. It involves applying traditional intelligence processes to network security, focusing on understanding both the attack and the adversary. This approach emphasizes the importance of not just detecting and responding to threats but also learning from them to improve future defenses.

A key aspect of intelligence-driven incident response is its ability to identify patterns and connections between seemingly isolated incidents. This understanding allows organizations to anticipate and respond to attacks more quickly. For example, Operation SMN, which targeted the Axiom Group, demonstrated the effectiveness of coordinated intelligence efforts in identifying and eradicating malware across multiple organizations.

Similarly, the SolarWinds incident highlighted the role of intelligence in identifying and responding to large-scale supply chain attacks. The collaboration among industry partners and the dissemination of findings allowed for a comprehensive understanding of the threat, illustrating the value of shared intelligence in improving overall security.

Financially motivated attacks, such as ransomware, also benefit from intelligence-driven responses. By identifying early indicators of compromise, organizations can mitigate these threats before they cause significant damage. This approach allows defenders to stay ahead of attackers by understanding their tactics and motivations.

Intelligence analysis, a core component of this approach, involves gathering and assessing data to provide actionable insights. Unlike other forms of research, intelligence analysis deals with adversaries who actively seek to conceal their activities. This requires a focus on secrecy, timeliness, and adaptability, as intelligence must be relevant and actionable when needed.

The distinction between data and intelligence is crucial. Data refers to raw facts and statistics, while intelligence is the refined analysis of this data to inform decision-making. Effective intelligence-driven incident response relies on transforming data into intelligence that can guide security efforts and improve resilience against cyber threats.

Overall, intelligence-driven incident response enhances an organization's ability to understand, detect, and respond to cyber threats. By integrating intelligence processes into security operations, organizations can develop a proactive defense strategy that not only addresses current threats but also prepares for future challenges. This approach requires a shift in mindset, focusing on continuous learning and adaptation to stay ahead of evolving cyber adversaries.



In information security, data such as IP addresses or domains becomes intelligence through analysis, processing, and dissemination. Intelligence must reach the right audience timely to be useful, as emphasized by Wilhelm Agrell, who likened intelligence analysis to combining journalism dynamics with scientific problem-solving. The distinction between data and intelligence lies in the analytical process, which transforms raw data into context-rich intelligence for decision-making.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), like IP addresses linked to malware, were once equated with threat intelligence. However, true threat intelligence encompasses more than IOCs, although they remain crucial in detecting and analyzing threats. IOCs should not be dismissed outright; they are valuable in threat detection and post-incident analysis.

Intelligence collection relies on various sources, including:

- **HUMINT**: Derived from human interactions, offering unique insights, such as firsthand accounts from individuals involved in security breaches.
- **SIGINT**: Involves intercepting signals, which is pivotal for technical intelligence.
- **OSINT**: Gathers data from publicly available sources, such as news and social media, providing valuable insights into cybersecurity threats.
- **IMINT and GEOINT**: Though not typical for cyber intelligence, they offer contextual information, like troop movements during cyber-attacks.
- **MASINT**: Involves technical means excluding signals and imagery, often not used in cyber threat intelligence.

Newer intelligence terms like CYBINT and TECHINT often overlap with existing methods like SIGINT and ELINT.

Specific cyber threat data may come from:

- **Incidents and investigations**: Rich data sets from breaches and response activities.
- **Honeypots and honeynets**: Simulated networks capturing attacker interactions.
- **Forums and chatrooms**: Restricted access areas where valuable information is exchanged.

Military terminology is prevalent in intelligence, drawn from documents like the US Joint Publication 2-0. However, it should be used judiciously to avoid confusion.

Models are essential for analysts to manage vast data and derive insights. They include mental models (cognitive perceptions) and conceptual models (explicit knowledge representations). The Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis exemplifies how codified models enhance understanding and questioning.

Using models promotes collaboration by articulating mental processes. Process models like the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) and the intelligence cycle help in decision-making and intelligence generation. The OODA loop, developed by John Boyd, emphasizes quick, decisive actions, applicable to both individuals and organizations.

In summary, intelligence in cybersecurity is about transforming data into actionable insights through structured analysis and models, ensuring timely and relevant dissemination to support effective decision-making.



The text delves into the dynamics of attacker-defender interactions, focusing on the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) used by both parties. It highlights the importance of quick observation and adaptation in cyber defense, emphasizing the unpredictability of human adversaries. The text advises defenders to align their actions with organizational goals to avoid decision paralysis.

Defenders must also consider how their actions impact other defenders, as sharing information can inadvertently benefit attackers if they adapt faster. The goal is to slow down adversaries' OODA loops while accelerating those of defenders.

The intelligence cycle is crucial for generating and evaluating intelligence. It involves six steps: direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback. Each step is critical, and skipping any can lead to ineffective intelligence. The cycle begins with establishing the intelligence requirement, followed by collecting data from diverse sources. Redundancy in data collection is valuable for corroboration.

Processing involves normalizing data into uniform formats, indexing for searchability, translating as needed, enriching with additional metadata, filtering irrelevant data, and prioritizing important information. Effective processing enhances future intelligence efforts.

Analysis is both an art and a science, requiring the use of analytic models to interpret data and make predictions. Analysts must identify information gaps and may need to revisit the collection phase if gaps are significant.

Dissemination ensures that intelligence reaches relevant stakeholders in a usable format, tailored to their needs. Feedback assesses whether the intelligence answered the original question, guiding future cycles.

The quality of intelligence depends on collection sources and analysis. Understanding the collection method and the date of collection is crucial, as much cyber threat data is perishable.

The text illustrates the intelligence cycle with a scenario involving a CISO's inquiry about a threat group, detailing how each step of the cycle is applied to provide comprehensive intelligence. Ultimately, good intelligence requires thorough understanding of data sources and addressing biases in analysis.



Understanding the lifespan and context of data is crucial for effective analysis. Data collection methods and dates provide context, helping analysts act on relevant information. Analysts must address biases like confirmation and anchoring biases to ensure quality intelligence. Intelligence is categorized into tactical, operational, and strategic levels, each serving different purposes and audiences.

**Tactical Intelligence**: This involves low-level, actionable information aiding security operations and incident response. It includes indicators of compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) used by adversaries. Tactical intelligence is used by security operations centers (SOCs) and computer incident response teams (CIRTs) to respond to threats like active exploitation of vulnerabilities.

**Operational Intelligence**: This level supports logistics and larger operations, involving more context than tactical intelligence. It includes information on campaigns, adversary responses, and actor attribution. Operational intelligence is crucial for senior analysts and cyber threat intelligence teams, helping them understand the broader implications of threats.

**Strategic Intelligence**: This is high-level information used by executives for risk assessment and organizational strategy. It encompasses threat trends and attacker motivations, providing a comprehensive view for decision-making.

**Confidence Levels**: Intelligence is associated with varying confidence levels, reflecting the trust in its accuracy. Confidence is assessed using scales like the Admiralty Code, evaluating source reliability and information content. Sherman Kent’s work on estimative probability provides qualitative methods to describe confidence in analysis.

Intelligence plays a vital role in incident response, which involves responding to detected intrusions. The incident-response cycle includes preparation, identification, containment, eradication, recovery, and lessons learned. Preparation involves hardening assets, deploying detection capabilities, and practicing response plans. Identification is the phase where adversary activity is detected, leading to investigation and response.

**Containment**: This phase involves immediate actions to mitigate adversary impact, such as disabling network ports or blocking malicious infrastructure. It’s a critical step to control the situation before further response actions.

The integration of intelligence into incident response enhances detection and response capabilities, allowing defenders to prepare and act effectively against adversaries. Shared vocabulary and models help streamline incident response, making complex events more manageable and successful.



Incident response involves several key phases to effectively manage and mitigate threats. The text outlines critical stages: Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned, emphasizing the need for strategic approaches to handle sophisticated adversaries.

**Eradication** focuses on long-term actions to remove adversaries from the environment permanently. Unlike temporary containment measures, eradication aims to eliminate the adversary's ability to regain access. This involves removing malware, resetting credentials, and patching vulnerabilities. A "scorched-earth" approach may be used, which involves extensive remediation, even on unaffected resources, to address unknown threats. Collaboration with risk management and system/service owners is crucial to determine the extent of these actions.

**Recovery** is about restoring systems to a pre-incident state. It involves undoing adversary actions and returning systems to normal operations. This phase requires coordination with IT and system owners, emphasizing teamwork and effective communication. Premature recovery can compromise the response, highlighting the importance of completing eradication first.

The **Lessons Learned** phase is essential for improving future incident responses. It involves evaluating the incident response process to identify successes, areas for improvement, and changes for future incidents. Despite resistance due to time constraints or fear of blame, this phase is crucial for advancing capabilities. Lessons learned can be applied to real incidents and exercises, helping teams refine their processes and justify necessary changes.

The **Kill Chain** concept provides a framework to understand adversary actions. It describes a series of steps adversaries take to achieve their objectives. While defenders focus on their actions in the incident response cycle, the kill chain highlights adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Understanding these can help defenders disrupt adversary activities, especially in pre-intrusion phases like targeting and reconnaissance.

**Reconnaissance** involves gathering information about the target, divided into hard data (technical aspects) and soft data (organizational information). Collection methods can be active (direct interaction) or passive (indirect collection). Detecting reconnaissance varies, with active methods being easier to spot. However, adversaries may use public services to obscure their activities, posing challenges for defenders.

The text emphasizes the importance of each phase in the incident response cycle, advocating for thorough evaluation and adaptation to improve security posture and response effectiveness.



GreyNoise plays a crucial role in identifying reconnaissance activities, especially during major vulnerabilities like the Log4J exploitation in 2021. Initially, it helped block malicious IPs, but as more entities began scanning, the data's utility diminished due to noise. Weaponization involves exploiting vulnerabilities where design and implementation diverge. Adversaries craft these exploits into deliverable forms, such as malicious documents. The choice of target software depends on its ubiquity and defense level. Widely used software like Adobe Acrobat is often targeted despite strong defenses, while niche software may offer easier but limited opportunities.

The Stuxnet incident exemplifies targeting specific vulnerabilities in less common software, like Siemens PLCs, crucial for the adversary's mission. Defenders counteract by employing secure development practices and patch management to reduce vulnerabilities, thus limiting adversaries' opportunities and ROI from exploits. Exploitability requires turning vulnerabilities into control over program execution, complicated by defenses like ASLR and EMET. Reliable exploits avoid detection and crashing systems, which could alert defenders.

Implant development aims to maintain access without repeated exploitation. Implants can be beaconing, communicating with command-and-control servers, or non-beaconing, awaiting commands. Development considers network topology and device type. Some attacks, like the Podesta email compromise, succeed without implants, complicating investigation due to fewer artifacts.

Testing in weaponization ensures functionality and undetectability. Malicious code must operate as intended and evade detection by security tools. Infrastructure development supports attacks with command-and-control servers, exfiltration points, and obfuscation methods. Certificates, servers, domains, and email addresses are crucial, with adversaries often using cloud services for anonymity. Nontechnical needs include identities and currency, often managed through pseudonyms and cryptocurrencies.

Delivery involves getting the payload to the victim, with methods like spear phishing and service exploitation. It's the first active stage, providing indicators of compromise. Exploitation is when adversaries gain control, initiating their code execution. This foothold is critical for network infiltration. Installation aims to establish persistence, often through remote-access Trojans, ensuring continued access despite system reboots.

Overall, the adversary's process involves reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, and installation, with each stage meticulously planned to achieve objectives while evading detection.



Adversaries often begin by securing a foothold on a few hosts using rootkits or remote-access Trojans (RATs), which provide kernel-level access and persist beyond reboots. They then expand their presence across networks by capturing credentials and deploying RATs on multiple systems, using tools like PsExec or SSH. This network persistence allows adversaries to access resources like VPNs and cloud services without deploying malware, reducing detection risk.

Command and control (C2) is critical for adversaries to issue commands to compromised systems. Historically, adversaries used IRC channels or HTTP calls, but now they might use DNS lookups or social media. Self-guided malware, like Stuxnet, operates without C2, particularly in air-gapped networks, requiring defenders to focus on identifying and eradicating the malware rather than monitoring network traffic.

The ultimate goal of adversaries is the actions on objective (AoO), such as data exfiltration or pivoting to reach the true target. Common AoO include destroying data, denying access (e.g., ransomware), degrading infrastructure, disrupting operations, or deceiving targets. These actions reveal the adversary's intent and identity, as they cannot be obfuscated.

Incident response involves identifying and reacting to these phases, ideally during the delivery phase to prevent execution. However, detection during later phases, like C2 or AoO, can lead to extensive investigations.

The kill chain framework helps visualize attacks, as demonstrated by a fictitious group, Grey Spike, targeting political campaigns. Their strategy includes targeting, reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, and C2, culminating in information retrieval.

The Diamond Model of intrusion analysis complements the kill chain by focusing on the interaction between adversaries, victims, capabilities, and infrastructure. Each event in this model represents an adversary using a capability against a victim, forming activity threads and groups. Analyzing the adversary-victim axis can reveal motivations and assist in strategic planning.

MITRE's ATT&CK framework extends these models, providing a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques. It categorizes actions into tactics (the "why") and techniques (the "how"), facilitating the development of threat models and methodologies. ATT&CK is widely used in cybersecurity to understand and counter adversary behaviors effectively.



**Groups and Intrusion Activity**: Security analysts track intrusion activities using terms like threat groups, activity groups, and campaigns. These clusters are used to understand adversary behavior and are crucial for cybersecurity defense strategies.

**ATT&CK Framework**: ATT&CK is a widely used model that catalogs tactics and techniques observed in real-world cyber operations. It serves as a resource for incident responders and intelligence teams to understand adversary trends. The framework is employed by various entities, including vendors and security evaluators, to enhance detection and defense mechanisms.

**Security Teams (Red, Blue, Purple, Black)**:
- **Blue Team**: Focuses on defense, including intrusion detection and incident response.
- **Red Team**: Conducts offensive testing to improve defenses, such as penetration testing.
- **Purple Team**: Facilitates collaboration between red and blue teams to enhance security posture.
- **Black Team**: Represents actual adversaries, though less commonly used.

**D3FEND Framework**: Developed by MITRE with NSA funding, D3FEND provides countermeasures and defensive techniques to mitigate specific offensive tactics. It complements ATT&CK by linking defensive strategies to adversary techniques.

**Active Defense**: Often misunderstood as "hack back," active defense includes strategies like denial, disruption, degradation, deception, and destruction. These actions aim to disrupt adversaries' operations and force them into mistakes, but must be executed with caution due to legal and operational risks.

**F3EAD Framework**: Combines intelligence and operations cycles, focusing on meaningful actions rather than just intelligence gathering. It consists of phases: Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, and Disseminate, promoting a continuous cycle of threat intelligence and incident response.

- **Find**: Identifying threats and determining targets based on intelligence.
- **Fix**: Locating adversaries within the network and understanding their presence.
- **Finish**: Executing incident response actions like containment and eradication.
- **Exploit**: Gathering information from adversaries, focusing on indicators of compromise and tactics.
- **Analyze**: Assessing collected data to understand adversary strategies and improve defenses.
- **Disseminate**: Sharing intelligence with decision-makers in a timely and actionable format.

Overall, these frameworks and strategies emphasize the importance of integrating intelligence and operational responses to effectively manage and mitigate cyber threats. They provide structured approaches to understanding and countering adversary activities, ensuring that security teams can adapt to evolving threats with informed defensive measures.



In intelligence-driven incident response, understanding the audience is crucial, typically categorized into tactical, strategic, and third-party groups. Tactical audiences, like incident-response teams, focus on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and summarized Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs). Strategic audiences, such as management, require generalized TTPs for resource allocation and business planning. Third-party audiences involve intelligence sharing, which requires clear rules of engagement.

The F3EAD (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate) process is a powerful framework for integrating threat intelligence and incident response. It emphasizes the cyclical relationship between operations and intelligence, where incident-response outputs feed into intelligence analysis, which then informs further operations. This model can be extended beyond security operations centers (SOCs) to include vulnerability management and application security teams.

Choosing the right model for intelligence analysis depends on factors like time constraints, data types, and analyst preferences. Models like the Diamond Model or OODA loop can be applied based on the situation's demands. The book explores the practical application of F3EAD, using a scenario called Road Runner, to illustrate the process.

The Find phase of F3EAD involves identifying adversaries, either proactively or reactively, through methods like actor-centric, victim-centric, and asset-centric targeting. Actor-centric investigations focus on unraveling information about attackers based on known tactics and techniques. This involves validating information, developing threat models, and using intelligence to guide the investigation.

David J. Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain illustrates the difficulty of changing different types of threat information. Lower levels, like hashes, change easily, while higher levels, like TTPs, are harder to alter and thus more valuable. The goal is to move up the pyramid to make it harder for adversaries to evade detection.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs), such as hashes and domain names, are basic data points used in investigations. Although they change frequently, they provide a starting point for deeper analysis. The focus is on gathering information that can be transformed into actionable intelligence, helping to identify and mitigate threats effectively.

Overall, the integration of intelligence and operations through models like F3EAD enhances the effectiveness of incident response by ensuring that information is gathered, analyzed, and disseminated in a structured manner. This approach not only addresses immediate threats but also informs strategic decision-making and resource allocation.



Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are key technical characteristics that signal known threats, attacker methodologies, or evidence of compromise. They are categorized into filesystem, memory, and network indicators, each useful in different contexts and with various tools. More complex to change are behaviors, captured as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) at the top of the Pyramid of Pain. These describe how tools are used to achieve attacker goals and are often understood through the kill chain model.

The kill chain helps in actor-centric targeting by identifying phases of an attack, such as reconnaissance, weaponization, delivery, exploitation, installation, command and control, and actions on objectives. Understanding these phases allows responders to anticipate attacker moves and identify similarities across attacks.

For example, in the Road Runner campaign, phishing emails targeted political campaigns, using weaponized PDFs exploiting CVE-2018-4916. Despite gaps in understanding, building a kill chain helps structure the investigation and anticipate future actions. Goals are inferred from victimology, focusing on campaign staff to gain network access.

Victim-centric targeting, a branch of criminology, examines the relationship between victim and offender, offering insights into adversary goals. This approach helps identify why victims were targeted and any commonalities they share. The Diamond Model is useful here, capturing victim-infrastructure and victim-capability connections.

In the Road Runner scenario, adversaries used generic email addresses and PDFs aligned with typical campaign communications. The phishing campaign targeted older versions of Adobe Acrobat Reader, highlighting vulnerable systems as potential targets. Understanding these connections aids in identifying additional victims and adversary motivations.

Victim-centric targeting also explores socio-political relationships between adversaries and victims, helping to identify potential future targets. By understanding the adversary's interest in specific victims, responders can gather critical data to enhance incident response and anticipate further actions. This approach, combined with actor-centric methods, provides a comprehensive strategy for handling cyber threats.



**Asset-Centric Targeting** focuses on protecting specific technologies, such as industrial control systems (ICS), even without confirmed adversary activity. This approach is useful for understanding potential attack vectors in complex systems by identifying who is capable of attacking these technologies. It helps prioritize the defense of assets by understanding the attackers' resource allocation, which is limited. Third-party research can aid both attackers and defenders by revealing potential attack methods or defense strategies.

Organizations with unique technologies, like power generation or IoT devices, benefit the most from asset-centric targeting. A customized approach is necessary, as demonstrated by Robert Lee’s ICS Cyber Kill Chain. In scenarios like Road Runner, asset-centric targeting can help identify gaps in adversary activity information, even when specifics are lacking.

**Capability-Centric Targeting** leverages adversaries' tools and methods. It involves identifying malware or other indicators, such as hashes or filenames, to find additional threats. This method helps in the Find phase by expanding on known capabilities, clustering similar items, and identifying patterns in malware use. It is crucial to avoid excessive pivots, stopping two steps from relevant information to prevent misdirection.

**Media-Centric Targeting** involves responding to public news or offhand comments that influence threat intelligence teams. While often seen as unfocused, these requests can provide valuable insights if distilled into specific queries. They help identify potential risks and connect dots within the intelligence process, providing stakeholders with necessary support.

**Third-Party Notification** involves being informed of a breach by an external entity. This notification provides initial targeting information, such as actors or indicators, prompting incident response. Effective use of third-party information requires demonstrating actionability, confidentiality, and operational security to encourage further sharing. Information-sharing groups enhance this process, though organizations must overcome reluctance to share information.

**Prioritizing Targeting** involves organizing information gathered in the Find phase based on immediacy, past incidents, and criticality. Immediate needs, such as stakeholder requests, take precedence. Past incidents provide valuable data for future detection, while criticality assesses the potential impact on operations. Organizing targeting activities ensures a structured approach to handling information, allowing for effective transition to subsequent phases.

Overall, these targeting methods—asset-centric, capability-centric, media-centric, and third-party notification—provide diverse strategies for identifying and prioritizing threats. By understanding the capabilities and motivations of adversaries, organizations can better protect their assets and respond to potential threats. Each method contributes uniquely to the intelligence process, ensuring comprehensive threat detection and response.



In incident response, differentiating between hard and soft leads is crucial. Hard leads provide context to known relevant activities within a network, while soft leads are potential indicators or behaviors not yet verified in the environment. During the Find phase, identifying and grouping these leads is essential for understanding threats. Proper documentation and tracking of leads prevent re-analysis and duplication of efforts, enabling efficient progression to subsequent phases.

Lead storage can be managed through spreadsheets or threat-intelligence platforms, ensuring compatibility with team workflows and visibility. A systematic approach to lead documentation includes recording core observations, datetime, context, and the analyst responsible. This organization aids in both reactive and proactive security measures.

Requests for Information (RFIs) streamline communication with external stakeholders, ensuring requests are prioritized and directed appropriately. RFIs should include a summary, requestor details, expected output, references, and a due date. Implementing a formal RFI system helps manage high volumes of requests.

The Find phase is integral to the F3EAD process, setting the stage for subsequent operations. The Fix phase utilizes intelligence from the Find phase to track adversary activity using indicators of compromise, behavioral indicators, and adversary goals. Intrusion detection is supported through network and system alerting, with external reflections aiding in recognizing similar threats.

Network alerting focuses on identifying malicious traffic, with stages like reconnaissance, delivery, command and control, lateral movement, and exfiltration being key points of detection. While reconnaissance alerting can be overwhelming due to high noise, delivery alerting is more effective, focusing on email attachments, links, and metadata.

Credential reuse remains a significant threat, often involving phishing to obtain user credentials. Monitoring for unusual login patterns, such as from unexpected locations or times, can help detect unauthorized access. User training to identify phishing attempts can also enhance detection capabilities.

Overall, the Find and Fix phases are foundational to incident response, requiring meticulous documentation and strategic intelligence application to effectively manage and mitigate security threats.



In incident response, detecting suspicious logins is crucial. Once an attacker is identified in a network, logs can be used to flag suspicious activity for further investigation, potentially leading to password resets and adding two-factor authentication (2FA).

**Command and Control (C2):** Attackers often need to communicate with their systems, resulting in network communication that can be monitored. Common C2 characteristics include:

1. **Destination:** Using threat intelligence to blacklist known malicious IPs or domains.
2. **Content:** Malware often uses encrypted messages. Detecting mismatches between content and protocol, such as encrypted HTTP traffic over port 80, can be indicative.
3. **Frequency:** Malware typically communicates at regular intervals, known as beacons.
4. **Duration:** Patterns in message length can reveal no-operation messages.
5. **Combinations:** High-fidelity alerts often require a combination of characteristics.

**Trends in C2:** Attackers adapt by misusing shared resources, such as social media and SaaS, complicating detection due to encrypted traffic and non-malicious destinations. In rare cases, malware operates without C2, requiring detection focused on delivery and impact.

**Data Exfiltration:** Detecting data leaving the network is crucial. Approaches include:

1. **Content-based:** Searching for patterns indicative of sensitive data.
2. **Metadata-based:** Monitoring for large data transfers, regardless of encryption.

**System Alerting:** Focused on specific phases of the kill chain, such as initial access, execution, and persistence. Tools must be tailored to operating systems, considering integration methods and the use of indicators like registry keys.

**Exploitation Alerting:** Involves monitoring process changes in real-time to detect intrusions. New or modified processes, often using homoglyphs, can indicate exploitation.

**Installation Alerting:** After exploitation, attackers seek persistence. Detecting installation of secondary tools, like RATs or rootkits, is essential.

**Impact Alerting:** Focuses on CRUD actions (Create, Read, Update, Delete) to detect ransomware or exfiltration. Understanding attacker goals helps tailor detection strategies.

**Case Study - Road Runner Campaign:** By analyzing the Grey Spike actor's methods, such as spear-phishing and web compromises, defenders can identify network and system activities indicative of an attack. Identifying C2 tools like Hikit and Derusbi, and vulnerabilities like CVE-2013-3893, helps in building a comprehensive detection strategy.

Overall, effective intrusion detection involves understanding attacker behavior, leveraging threat intelligence, and integrating system and network monitoring tools to detect and respond to malicious activities.



Understanding and mitigating network vulnerabilities involves several key phases: installation, impact assessment, and intrusion investigation. Road Runner, a threat actor, uses tools like Hikit in 32-bit and 64-bit variants, depending on the network. Identifying files and directories involved in the installation is crucial. Road Runner targets systems with economic, environmental, and energy policy information, often expanding to multiple hosts to gather and exfiltrate data, necessitating monitoring for lateral movement.

Intrusion investigation differentiates alerting from investigation workflows. While alerting focuses on identifying specific malicious activities, investigation gathers extensive data to analyze and contextualize threats. This involves network traffic analysis, memory analysis, and malware analysis. Network analysis begins with traffic analysis, which uses metadata to identify adversary patterns without needing full content. Key activities to monitor include connections to known malicious IPs, malware beaconing, and potential data exfiltration.

Traffic analysis tools collect network flow data, such as NetFlow, Bro, SiLK, and Argus. These tools offer insights through metadata, allowing for cost-effective long-term storage and analysis. Intelligence applied to traffic analysis involves identifying connections to known malicious resources and detecting anomalous patterns. Traffic analysis can generate leads by identifying top and bottom talkers, which may indicate suspicious activity.

Signature-based analysis, situated between traffic analysis and full content monitoring, focuses on specific content patterns using intrusion detection systems (IDS). IDS utilize rules and signatures, like Snort, to detect known threats. Key actions include generating alerts, logging packets, and blocking traffic. Effective signature-based analysis requires creating, modifying, and removing signatures based on intelligence. This analysis can identify patterns of past attacks and provide a starting point for further investigation.

Full content analysis captures every byte of network traffic, allowing for detailed examination and reanalysis with new intelligence. Despite its storage demands, full content provides comprehensive insights, enabling the recreation of user activities and the application of new tools retroactively. Tools like Wireshark facilitate packet-level filtering and analysis. Full content analysis is valuable for developing signatures and detecting protocol anomalies, although challenges such as TLS encryption complicate content alerting.

Overall, combining traffic, signature, and full content analyses provides a robust framework for identifying and mitigating network threats, leveraging both historical and real-time data to enhance security measures.



The text covers various aspects of cybersecurity investigations, focusing on techniques and tools used in live response, memory analysis, disk analysis, enterprise detection and response (EDR), and malware analysis.

**Live Response**: This involves analyzing a potentially compromised system without taking it offline, preserving system state information such as active processes and configurations. Early live response tools, often built with scripting languages, have largely been deprecated or integrated into larger systems. These tools collect artifacts quickly, and intelligence integration typically occurs in the backend. For example, tools like OSXCollector output data for analysis with additional intelligence sources.

**Memory Analysis**: This technique captures volatile system state information from memory, providing insights into processes that might run stealthily. Memory analysis usually involves a clear separation between data collection and analysis. Tools like Volatility and Mandiant’s Redline allow for extensive analysis, including malware detection and cryptographic key extraction. Volatility, for instance, can use Yara signatures to scan memory for specific artifacts.

**Disk Analysis**: Traditional disk forensics involves extracting filesystem information using specialized tools like EnCase and FTK. This process, called file carving, builds data structures from raw data until files and system artifacts are accessible. Analysts can explore persistence mechanisms, hidden files, and malware artifacts. Disk analysis is less volatile and allows revisiting data, unlike live response or memory analysis. However, disk encryption can pose challenges, often mitigated by EDR tools that operate while systems are live.

**Enterprise Detection and Response (EDR)**: EDR tools consolidate various investigative functions, including threat detection, system state collection, and post-compromise remediation. These tools aim to be comprehensive solutions for security teams, although they may have strengths and weaknesses depending on the platform. Integration with data sources and workflows is crucial for effective use, and the choice of EDR system depends on organizational needs and architecture.

**Malware Analysis**: This involves static and dynamic techniques to understand malware behavior. Basic static analysis gathers metadata like file hashes and types, while dynamic analysis observes malware in a controlled environment, typically a sandbox. Advanced static analysis, often requiring reverse engineering skills, involves disassembling binaries to understand their capabilities. Tools like Yara help in detecting and classifying malware.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of integrating intelligence and automating processes in cybersecurity investigations to enhance efficiency and effectiveness. The choice of tools and methods should align with the specific needs and architecture of the organization.



Reverse engineering and malware analysis are critical skills in cybersecurity, involving tools like IDA Pro and NSA's Ghidra for static analysis. Reverse engineers often create custom tools to understand malware, which can be complex and time-consuming. This process is usually reserved for high-priority cases or prolific malware samples. Advanced security teams, such as those at Microsoft or CrowdStrike, typically employ reverse engineers, but other teams might work with firms on retainer for these capabilities.

Intelligence plays a crucial role in malware analysis, guiding reverse engineers to focus on specific areas, such as encryption keys or alternative data collection methods. Malware analysis generates valuable data, including indicators and attacker tactics, which are essential for detection and alerting on networks and hosts. Clear communication between intelligence analysts and reverse engineers is vital to avoid unnecessary work.

Malware analysis requires a deep understanding of programming, operating systems, and malware behavior. Resources like "Malware Analyst’s Cookbook" and "Practical Malware Analysis" provide foundational knowledge, while courses like SANS Reverse-Engineering Malware offer hands-on training. Continuous learning and adaptation are necessary in this field.

Scoping is a key part of incident response, determining the extent of an incident and affected resources. This process informs the impact assessment and response strategies. Effective scoping requires good inventory management and collaboration with IT teams. It involves analyzing patterns among affected systems and using established data like IOCs to identify threats.

Hunting is a proactive approach to detect threats without prior alerts, relying on planning, process, instinct, and intelligence. It involves developing and testing hypotheses to identify potential threats. Testing helps refine hunting methods to avoid false positives and unnecessary noise.

The Finish phase of incident response involves eradicating threats and remediating vulnerabilities. It focuses on resources within an organization's control, avoiding illegal actions like hacking back. The Finish phase includes mitigating delivery methods, command and control, and actions on objectives to prevent adversaries from regaining access. Mitigation should be swift and coordinated to minimize adversary responses.

Overall, integrating intelligence into alerting, investigation, and hunting enhances processes and tools, helping teams respond effectively to threats. The ultimate goal is to understand the scope of incidents and develop a response plan to neutralize threats and secure networks.



In cybersecurity, mitigating and remediating threats involves several critical strategies to ensure system security and integrity. Attackers often use multiple tactics to maintain access, such as deploying secondary Remote Access Trojans (RATs) with longer communication intervals, making them harder to detect. It's crucial to revoke all sessions when changing compromised passwords, as attackers can remain logged in despite password changes. This is especially important for application-specific passwords that may not automatically change.

Mitigating actions focus on limiting access to sensitive information, reducing network transport options to prevent data exfiltration, and stopping malware actions. This involves network access controls and limiting outbound connections. In the case of the Road Runner campaign, spear-phishing emails were used to gain access. Mitigation included rerouting suspicious emails to a sandbox for analysis and blocking command-and-control traffic at the firewall and system levels.

Remediation involves removing adversary capabilities and invalidating compromised resources. This includes patching vulnerabilities to prevent exploitation and remediating installations by deleting malware and reverting system changes. A critical decision in remediation is whether to remove malware or completely reformat the system. Reformatting is recommended for certainty in malware removal, although it may not always be feasible for specialized systems.

Actions on objective, such as data theft or ransomware attacks, require specific remediation strategies. For ransomware, understanding the family and characteristics, detecting early, and having backups are crucial. Organizations must decide whether to pay ransoms, considering legal implications. Remediation can also involve blocking network activity or invalidating stolen credentials.

In the Road Runner case, sophisticated malware like GoldMax was used. The response included rebuilding compromised machines and implementing allow-lists for known good activity. Monitoring and patching outdated systems, such as those vulnerable to CVE-2018-4916, were part of the remediation process.

Rearchitecture involves strategic changes based on incident-response data to prevent future breaches. This can include system configuration tweaks, user training, or complete network rearchitecture. Identifying and addressing architecture-related issues, such as outdated systems and inadequate authentication controls, is essential for long-term security improvements.

Overall, effective incident response requires a balance of immediate mitigation, thorough remediation, and strategic rearchitecture to enhance security and resilience against future threats.



Adversary activity in cybersecurity requires strategic planning and tactical actions to prevent chaos and missed opportunities. Key actions include deny, degrade, disrupt, deceive, and destroy, all aimed at removing attackers from networks. These actions should always occur within the defender's network.

**Deny**: This is the initial response to attacker activity, aiming to remove their access by changing credentials, removing backdoors, and preventing lateral movement within the network. It's crucial to address all methods used by attackers to ensure complete denial of access.

**Disrupt**: When denying access is insufficient, disruption aims to prevent attackers from achieving their objectives by forcing them to take ineffective actions. This involves understanding what attackers are targeting and restricting access to that information, often requiring additional authentication measures.

**Degrade**: Unlike deny and disrupt, degrade involves reducing the effectiveness of an attack by slowing down communication or other activities, making it less useful for the adversary.

**Deceive**: Deception involves misleading attackers with false information or honeypots, systems set up to look legitimate but are used to detect unauthorized access. Effective deception requires a balance of authenticity and enticement to avoid detection by attackers.

**Destroy**: This action is rarely used as it involves causing physical damage to systems within your network. It is not recommended unless necessary for compromised antiquated systems.

**Organizing Incident Data**: Recording detailed information during and after incidents is crucial. This includes leads, attacker tactics, compromised hosts, and response actions. The goal is to create a single source of truth for all responders to coordinate effectively.

**Tools for Tracking Actions**: Various tools are available to track incident data. Starting with personal notes, teams often progress to shared spreadsheets like the "Spreadsheet of Doom" (SOD) for tracking indicators of compromise and response actions. Consistency in data entry is vital for exploiting spreadsheets effectively.

**Third-party and Purpose-Built Solutions**: Teams may use third-party tools like Kanban boards or wikis, focusing on usability and integration with workflows. Purpose-built tools like FIR (Fast Incident Response) offer a dedicated platform for incident response, balancing utility and customizability.

In summary, effective incident response involves a combination of strategic actions and organized data management to prevent, detect, and respond to adversary activities within a network. The use of appropriate tools and techniques is essential for maintaining security and minimizing damage.



In incident response, assessing damage is crucial, often requiring collaboration with business units, IT, sales, and insurance teams. Quantifying damage in monetary terms is vital for engaging law enforcement, as they may intervene only when costs surpass a jurisdiction-specific threshold.

The monitoring lifecycle is a key part of the response, encompassing creation, testing, deployment, refinement, and retirement of detection signatures. Creation involves developing a signature to monitor observables in systems. Testing, often skipped, is essential to identify false positives and involves using known good data or deploying detections in a "monitor only" mode. Deployment follows testing, requiring collaboration with detection teams for feedback, which aids in refinement. Refinement adjusts overly specific or broad detections and optimizes performance. Eventually, signatures are retired when threats are mitigated or become obsolete, though they might still be useful in specific contexts.

The Exploit phase of F3EAD (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate) focuses on leveraging intelligence gathered during incident response. This phase aims to transform tactical advantages into strategic ones by understanding adversaries to prevent future attacks. The tactical OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) is used for immediate response, while the strategic loop focuses on long-term defense.

Exploitation involves organizing data into usable formats for analysis, akin to a chef preparing ingredients. It includes extracting technical indicators, tactics, techniques, vulnerabilities, and contextual information. This process helps identify risks and inform strategic security measures.

Proper implementation of F3EAD can prevent repeated intrusions, as seen in the Equifax breach, where inadequate response to known vulnerabilities led to significant data loss. The Exploit phase requires gathering, storing, and managing information systematically, ensuring that lessons learned translate into actionable intelligence.

Key components of the Exploit process include collecting data, standardizing it, and maintaining it for future reference. This involves organizing information into categories like technical indicators, tactics, supporting information, references, and internal actions. Documented processes facilitate consistent improvement and knowledge sharing, ensuring robust incident response and strategic planning.



In incident response, managing disorganized data is common, but the Exploit process aids in organizing and extracting valuable intelligence for future use. Teams often deal with varied data sources, from spreadsheets to Post-it® notes, and the key is to extract useful information for intelligence analysis. Data typically falls into high-level narratives or technical details like malware analysis. Combining these levels enhances intelligence power.

**Information-Gathering Goals:**
- **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** Despite debate, IOCs remain valuable for tracking adversaries.
- **Signatures:** Tools like Snort and Yara can extract advanced indicators.
- **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):** Understanding adversary operations is crucial.
- **Strategic Data:** Non-technical data about attribution and motivation is high value.

**Mining Previous Incidents:**
Reviewing past incidents helps integrate operations and intelligence, revealing threats and information gaps. Always include dates for context.

**Gathering External Information:**
External sources provide context and situational awareness. Like a literature review, this process identifies unique aspects and builds collective threat understanding. Keep external data separate and cite sources clearly.

**Extracting and Storing Threat Data:**
Data from investigations should be structured for analysis. This can be manual or platform-based, using spreadsheets or centralized platforms. Standards simplify this process.

**Data Standards and Formats:**
- **STIX/TAXII:** Widely adopted for sharing threat data, STIX 2 uses JSON, simplifying integration.
- **MILE Working Group:** Maintains standards like IODEF for incident sharing.
- **OpenIOC:** An XML-based schema for capturing IOCs, though largely deprecated now.

Strategic information often lacks formal storage standards and ends up in documents or slides, highlighting a gap in capturing strategic intelligence effectively. Understanding and using these standards ensures comprehensive threat data management and enhances incident response capabilities.



The text discusses three primary frameworks for storing strategic information related to cyber threats: ATT&CK, VERIS, and CAPEC. 

**ATT&CK**: Developed by MITRE in 2013, ATT&CK categorizes attacker behaviors throughout the attack lifecycle, initially focusing on Microsoft Windows but expanding to include Linux, macOS, mobile platforms, cloud systems, and more. It uses a model with tags, fields, and relationships to capture both tactical and strategic information, helping organizations understand adversary tactics and techniques.

**VERIS**: The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) supports the Verizon Data Breach Incident Report (DBIR) and captures information in four categories: Actor, Action, Asset, and Attribute. It answers specific questions about incidents, such as who was involved, what actions were taken, which assets were affected, and how they were impacted. VERIS helps organizations understand risks rather than generating detailed technical rules.

**CAPEC**: The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) framework aids in developing secure software by capturing attack patterns, including prerequisites, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and attacker steps. It provides insights into how attackers operate and adapt, helping organizations strengthen their defenses.

The text outlines a four-step process for extracting and managing threat data:

1. **Identify Goals**: Clearly define the intended outcomes of data management, supporting teams, and impact.
   
2. **Identify Tools**: Use tools that facilitate achieving goals, such as threat-intelligence platforms (TIPs), scripts, or collaboration tools.

3. **Develop a System**: Create a systematic process for aggregating and organizing data, ensuring no information is overlooked.

4. **Launch and Iterate**: Implement the process, adapt as needed, and document useful methods for future use.

Managing information involves capturing key details like date, source, and data-handling protocols such as the Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) to ensure proper information sharing and retention.

**Threat-Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)**: TIPs simplify the process of gathering, storing, and analyzing threat information. They can handle large quantities of Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and support various data formats. Examples include:

- **MISP**: A free platform for managing malware-based threat data with robust sharing capabilities.
- **CRITs**: Developed by MITRE, integrates with STIX and TAXII for sharing threat information.
- **YETI**: Designed for organizing and analyzing threat components, supporting indicator enrichment and multiple data formats.

Commercial TIP solutions offer similar features with added support and ease of setup, suitable for organizations with limited resources.

In conclusion, storing and managing information from investigations is crucial for analysis and dissemination. Organizations should explore different systems to find the best fit for their needs, ensuring they can adapt to and learn from threats effectively.



The Analyze phase in the F3EAD cycle is crucial for transforming data into actionable intelligence. This involves a smaller intelligence cycle to determine requirements and collect additional data to enrich existing information. During this phase, analysts identify patterns and predict future behaviors by examining technical details such as domains and IP addresses used in intrusions.

A key aspect of analysis is dual-process thinking, involving both fast (system 1) and slow (system 2) thinking. System 1 is quick and relies on pre-existing mental models, while system 2 is deliberate, countering biases and requiring a firm understanding of context. System 2 thinking is essential for generating insights that can be clearly articulated and defended.

Reasoning in analysis involves deductive, inductive, and abductive approaches. Deductive reasoning derives conclusions from universally accepted premises but is less common in investigations due to imperfect information. Inductive reasoning involves generalizing from specific instances, often leading to quick conclusions but requiring refinement as more data becomes available. Abductive reasoning combines elements of the other two, using available information and past rules to infer plausible causes, making it most suitable for investigations where perfect information is rare.

The OPM breach serves as a case study illustrating the importance of effective analysis. Despite available information, failures to connect the dots led to significant consequences. The breach underscores the need for timely and comprehensive analysis to prevent or mitigate the impact of complex campaigns.

Analytic processes in incident response rely on cognitive skills such as memory, logic, and reasoning. Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) provide a repeatable and explainable approach to analysis, countering cognitive biases and system 1 thinking flaws. SATs help guide the analysis process, ensuring that conclusions are well-founded and reproducible.

Overall, the Analyze phase is about taking a structured approach to processing information, using appropriate reasoning methods, and applying cognitive skills to derive meaningful intelligence from data. This phase is integral to understanding and predicting adversary tactics, ultimately enhancing the effectiveness of incident response efforts.



Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) are essential in intelligence analysis, divided into six families: Getting Organized, Exploration, Diagnostic, Reframing, Foresight, and Decision-Support techniques. These methods guide analysts in organizing data, exploring new approaches, diagnosing hypotheses, reframing biases, predicting outcomes, and supporting decision-making.

**Getting Organized Techniques** help analysts manage data, using methods like sorting and checklists. In incident response, these are useful for analyzing old incident data.

**Exploration Techniques** encourage innovative thinking and challenge biases. Methods include brainstorming and mind mapping to explore relationships between elements.

**Diagnostic Techniques** are crucial in incident response, resembling the scientific method. Key methods include Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH), Multiple-Hypothesis Generation, and Deception Detection.

**Reframing Techniques** help identify biases in analysis. Techniques like Red Hat Analysis and What If? Analysis are best done in groups to expose flawed mental models.

**Foresight Techniques** aim to predict future outcomes. Indicator Generation, Validation, and Evaluation are particularly useful for anticipating changes in incident response.

**Decision-Support Techniques** structure information to aid decision-makers. Techniques like SWOT Analysis help in presenting findings to leaders.

To choose the right SAT, analysts must define the question, identify its nature, review data, and consider team dynamics. Core techniques include Key Assumptions Check, ACH, and Indicator Evaluation, addressing biases and supporting structured analysis.

**Key Assumptions Check** involves identifying and validating assumptions. Analysts list assumptions, question their validity, and categorize them based on evidence, ensuring assumptions are periodically rechecked.

**Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)** evaluates multiple hypotheses to identify the most likely one. The process involves identifying hypotheses, listing evidence, creating a matrix to assess evidence support, refining the matrix, drawing conclusions, and identifying when to reevaluate analysis.

**Indicator Generation, Validation, and Evaluation** in structured analysis extends beyond traditional IOCs, focusing on identifying and validating indicators to anticipate potential threats.

These SATs provide a systematic approach to intelligence analysis, helping analysts manage biases, structure data, and support decision-making effectively.



Indicator Generation, Validation, and Evaluation is a Structured Analytic Technique (SAT) crucial for intelligence-driven incident response. It involves creating a list of indicators to identify patterns suggesting specific activities. For example, indicators such as malicious emails mimicking organizational activities or adversaries exploiting vulnerabilities requiring user interaction are used to track potential threats. Changes in these indicators may suggest shifts in the threat landscape, necessitating continuous monitoring and analysis.

Indicators must be validated and evaluated to ensure reliability. They should be observable, specific, and not influenced by unrelated factors. Ideal indicators are highly likely to identify relevant activities, while non-diagnostic indicators might appear in various scenarios. Regular monitoring and reevaluation of these indicators are essential to maintain their effectiveness.

Contrarian techniques, such as devil’s advocate, "What if" analysis, and red team analysis, challenge existing judgments and introduce new perspectives. These methods help uncover biases and test the robustness of analyses. Red team analysis, for instance, involves adopting an adversary's mindset to anticipate their actions, while the Futures Wheel technique explores potential outcomes of decisions by mapping hypothetical possibilities.

Target-Centric Analysis, as presented by Robert M. Clark, emphasizes collaboration among intelligence collectors, analysts, and customers. This approach addresses failures in information sharing, analysis, and action by removing silos and fostering a collective understanding. It involves developing a conceptual model of the target, often adversary networks, to prevent, detect, and respond to malicious activities.

The target-centric process is iterative, involving regular stakeholder engagement and updates to the model based on new intelligence. This ensures that actionable intelligence is shared promptly and that analysis adapts to changing requirements. The method encourages frequent check-ins with stakeholders to ensure that the analysis meets their evolving needs.

In summary, effective intelligence analysis involves generating and validating indicators, employing contrarian techniques to challenge assumptions, and adopting a target-centric approach for collaborative and adaptive intelligence processes. These methods help analysts counter biases, improve reliability, and provide actionable insights in intelligence-driven incident response.



When analyzing data, it is crucial to ask specific questions to derive meaningful insights. Questions like "Why were we targeted?" or "How could this attack have been prevented?" guide the analysis process, helping to identify additional intrusions and protect against future attacks. Understanding the nature of an attack, whether it targets data integrity, confidentiality, or availability, provides insights into the attacker’s goals, which change less frequently than their tactics.

Identifying the attackers is often a priority for executives, but it’s more important to understand their goals, tactics, and patterns. This includes analyzing their methods, targets, operational hours, and infrastructure. Knowing how an attack could have been prevented involves examining network vulnerabilities, unaddressed IDS alerts, and user errors, such as password reuse. This analysis is crucial to avoid repeating the incident-response process.

Detection strategies depend on the security systems in place and require focusing on unique aspects of the attack, such as malware hashes and command-and-control IP addresses. Identifying patterns and trends, especially when comparing internal incidents with external reports, can reveal campaigns or shared attack infrastructures.

Enriching data is the next step in the analysis process, providing additional context to indicators. This includes WHOIS information, which helps track attacker infrastructure and identify compromised domains. Passive DNS information, which records domain resolutions over time, can be paired with WHOIS data for a comprehensive view of an indicator.

Certificates, both for encryption and code-signing, offer rich information due to the stringent requirements for obtaining them. Malware information, including detection ratios and behavioral analysis, helps understand the attack's scope and sophistication. Internal enrichment data, such as business operations and user information, provides context about why an attack was successful.

Information sharing with other organizations, through formal or informal groups, offers nonpublic insights that enhance analysis. Once all data is enriched and evaluated, developing a hypothesis is the next step. This involves synthesizing all information to form analytic judgments, ensuring they are complete, accurate, and reproducible. Documenting hypotheses, even speculative ones, is essential for refining the analysis process.



In analyzing cybersecurity incidents, forming and evaluating hypotheses is crucial. Initially, it's essential to determine if an attack was targeted. For instance, in the "Road Runner" intrusion, the hypothesis was that it aimed to access sensitive campaign information. This assumption was based on observed tactics and internal data. However, hypotheses must be scrutinized through a structured analytic process, accounting for assumptions and biases.

Key assumptions underpinning a hypothesis must be identified and evaluated. This involves understanding why assumptions were made, assessing their confidence levels, and challenging their validity. Removing unsupported assumptions is vital, though a hypothesis can remain if backed by other strong evidence.

Cognitive biases, such as confirmation, anchoring, availability, bandwagon effect, and mirroring, can distort analysis. Confirmation bias leads analysts to favor evidence supporting preexisting beliefs. Anchoring bias causes over-reliance on initial information. Availability bias emphasizes familiar information, while the bandwagon effect relies on group consensus without evidence. Mirroring assumes others think like the analyst, skewing judgment.

To mitigate biases, analysts should engage in structured analytic techniques (SATs) and focus on disproving hypotheses rather than confirming them. Evaluating evidence involves assessing its likelihood and confidence, identifying key pieces influencing judgment, and articulating circumstances for reevaluation.

Judgments should be clear, citing evidence and confidence levels, ensuring others can understand the findings without needing the analyst's perspective. Analysts should also specify indicators for ongoing monitoring to support or refute judgments. This structured approach enhances the accuracy and reliability of cybersecurity analysis.



In the dissemination phase of analysis, the focus is on organizing, publishing, and sharing intelligence effectively. The key to successful analysis is to slow down and engage in deliberate reasoning, which helps counter biases and ensures that all necessary steps are followed. This careful approach leads to a smoother process and supports sound analytic judgment.

Dissemination is crucial as it transforms analysis into actionable insights for decision-makers. Poor dissemination can undermine good analysis, so it requires a disciplined writing style, an understanding of stakeholders, and attention to operational security. Intelligence products must be audience-focused, actionable, and structured effectively.

Understanding the audience is essential for creating useful intelligence products. Different stakeholders, such as executives, internal technical teams, and external partners, have varied needs. Executive leadership, for example, requires intelligence that aids in strategic business decisions. They value brief and concise reports with operational intelligence that tells a compelling story. Internal technical customers, like SOC analysts, need detailed, tactical products to assist in intrusion detection and incident response. External technical customers require translatable intelligence, with careful consideration of sharing permissions and feedback mechanisms.

For executive leadership, intelligence products should focus on strategic implications and be concise, often starting with an executive summary. Internal technical customers benefit from detailed, technical reports that include references and machine-consumable data like IOCs. External sharing involves understanding permissions and potential risks of exposure, ensuring that shared intelligence remains professional and secure.

Effective dissemination involves understanding customer goals, anticipating their questions, and continuously evolving products based on feedback. This process ensures that intelligence is not only shared but also utilized effectively to support decision-making and enhance organizational security.



In intelligence dissemination, understanding your audience is crucial. Developing customer personas helps tailor intelligence products effectively. Personas describe hypothetical customers, detailing their characteristics, challenges, and needs. This approach, borrowed from marketing, ensures that intelligence products meet the specific needs of different stakeholders, such as a technical SOC team or a high-level C-suite executive. Personas should be dynamic, reflecting changes in roles or individuals.

For instance, a VP of Security like Shawn, who is highly technical, would require detailed, accurate intelligence products. Conversely, generalized personas can guide product development for common roles, like SOC analysts. These personas should evolve with personnel changes to remain relevant.

Authorship is equally important. Writers must be knowledgeable about the subject to maintain credibility and convey information effectively. They should write about topics within their expertise to avoid errors and misunderstandings. Automated tools can enhance reports but must be used cautiously. Authors should understand and contextualize automated data to avoid inaccuracies.

Actionability is a key aspect of intelligence products. They should enable customers to take informed actions or decisions. Products should provide actionable information, like adversary TTPs or IOCs, to enhance network defense. Avoid vague descriptions and overclassification, which can render intelligence unactionable. Understand customer needs, technology, maturity, and methodologies to tailor actionable products.

The writing process for intelligence involves planning, drafting, and editing. Planning focuses on understanding the audience, authorship, and actionability. Drafting can start with a thesis, facts, or an outline. Using narrative enhances engagement and impact. Editing is critical and often requires collaboration. Techniques like involving a second reader or taking breaks can improve editing quality.

Overall, creating effective intelligence products requires a deep understanding of audience needs, careful authorship, and a structured writing process to ensure clarity, accuracy, and actionability.



Effective editing in intelligence writing involves improving organization, ensuring accuracy, and enhancing clarity. Key pitfalls include using passive voice, uncommon terms, and leading language. Editors must distinguish known facts from suspicions to prevent stakeholder misjudgments. Tools like spellcheckers and grammar checkers aid in automation, while advanced tools can identify inefficient constructs.

Intelligence products benefit from brevity and the removal of redundant information. Visual aids such as graphics can make data more engaging and memorable. The structure of intelligence products is defined by goals, audience, and actionability, with templates guiding the process. Templates help maintain consistency and address specific needs, adapting based on feedback.

Short-form products, like event summaries and IOC reports, address tactical needs and are quickly actionable. They provide concise information on incidents, actors, and indicators. Naming conventions for incidents and actors should be memorable and public-friendly.

Long-form products, such as malware and campaign reports, cover broader topics and require more effort. They provide comprehensive views and are developed by larger teams. These products include detailed technical analysis and strategic insights.

Intelligence writing structures often follow a "What? So What? Now What?" format, presenting facts, their importance, and recommended actions. This approach varies based on customer expertise and needs. Strategic customers may only read relevant sections, so clear executive summaries and tables of contents are crucial.

Overall, intelligence products must be clear, concise, and actionable, with a focus on meeting customer needs and maintaining accuracy.



The document details a comprehensive analysis of a cyber intrusion campaign, mapping the attack stages against the cyber kill chain and using the diamond model to describe adversary characteristics. Key stages include:

- **Reconnaissance**: The attacker gathers pre-attack information, identifying targets and vulnerabilities.
  
- **Weaponization**: The setup and configuration of the attack are prepared, involving tools and techniques.
  
- **Delivery**: Methods are employed to introduce the exploit into the target environment.
  
- **Exploitation**: The adversary takes control of the target system through identified vulnerabilities.
  
- **Installation**: Persistence is achieved on the host after exploitation.
  
- **Command & Control**: The attacker communicates with compromised resources to maintain control.
  
- **Actions On Objectives**: The ultimate goals of the attacker are pursued using specific tools and techniques.

The timeline of the incident is documented with specific actions and dates, highlighting the progression of the attack. Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are identified, including network and host indicators, and detection signatures for network and host systems are provided, such as Snort and Yara rules.

Observations and analyst notes are recorded to track insights and findings during the incident response. The document also discusses related intelligence products, both internal and external, and emphasizes the importance of intelligence estimates for strategic decision-making.

The Request for Information (RFI) process is outlined, detailing how specific intelligence questions are submitted, processed, and responded to, ensuring a structured workflow for intelligence requests.

Date and time formats are standardized to avoid confusion, recommending the YYYYMMDD format and UTC time for consistency. Automated consumption products are discussed, emphasizing the use of structured and semi-structured IOCs for integration with detection and analysis tools.

The document concludes with a discussion on automated IOC formats, such as STIX 2, highlighting their utility for sharing indicators across diverse systems and tools. STIX 2 is particularly valuable for public reporting, allowing for broad distribution of threat intelligence in a standardized format.



STIX provides a standardized format for threat intelligence, aiding teams in sharing and understanding data. Establishing a rhythm in intelligence dissemination is crucial. Regularly released products, like situational awareness reports, maintain stakeholder interest and communication, while ad hoc releases respond to immediate events. Balancing frequency and content is key to avoiding stakeholder disengagement or confusion.

Distribution methods should align with audience needs, balancing ease and security. Portals like SharePoint are effective for sharing intelligence within teams, while emails and printed copies suit less-sensitive information for executives. Feedback is vital for refining intelligence products. It includes technical feedback on meeting stakeholder needs and format feedback on product usefulness. Open communication channels and regular feedback improve processes and product relevance.

Regular intelligence products keep customers informed about threats and security news, maintaining constant engagement. A weekly threat report can effectively serve diverse stakeholders, from SOC analysts to executives, by providing updates on investigations and situational awareness.

Effective dissemination requires products that are accurate, audience-focused, and actionable. Analysts should consider the goal, audience, product length, intelligence level, and language tone. Continuous feedback loops between analysts, writers, editors, and customers are crucial for process improvement and product enhancement.

Strategic intelligence plays a vital role in intelligence-driven incident response (IDIR) by providing context and aiding long-term planning. It helps organizations learn from incidents, preventing repeated vulnerabilities. Strategic intelligence involves understanding geopolitical, economic, social, and technological contexts. It aids decision-makers in shaping policies and strategies, benefiting all organizational levels.

Sherman Kent, a pioneer in intelligence analysis, emphasized strategic intelligence's role in informing policy makers. Today, leaders face information overload rather than scarcity. Strategic intelligence helps shape response processes, identify critical requirements, and position defenses based on threat landscapes. Post-incident, it integrates new insights into organizational understanding, answering key questions about threats and effectiveness.

While primarily used before and after incidents, strategic intelligence can resolve contradictions during incident response by providing new analytical frames. This adaptability ensures that intelligence remains relevant and actionable, supporting both immediate and long-term security goals.



Reframing a mindset is challenging for incident responders who often focus on immediate details. Strategic intelligence aids in seeing the bigger picture, countering biases, and improving decision-making beyond just incident response. It supports leadership decisions and enhances other security processes like red teaming, where internal teams simulate adversaries to test defenses. However, these simulations must closely resemble real threats to be effective, which requires red teams to adapt their tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) based on actual adversary profiles.

Vulnerability management is crucial for reducing attack surfaces by identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities before exploitation. This process is heavily reliant on metrics such as CVSS scores but must also consider real-world threat intelligence to prioritize remediation effectively. For instance, the Log4Shell vulnerability required a shift in focus from external to internal systems based on evolving intelligence.

Strategic intelligence also informs architecture and engineering decisions, enhancing system resilience by understanding adversary methods. Resilience involves resistance, retention, recovery, and resurgence, with only resistance occurring before an attack. Strategic intelligence helps anticipate adversary moves and prepare responses.

Beyond technical systems, human systems also require protection from cyber threats. Building resilient human systems involves creating environments that do not exacerbate vulnerabilities, leveraging strategic intelligence for decision support.

Strategic intelligence involves both analysis and synthesis to understand complex systems. Framing helps define and study problems, while synthesis identifies relationships and changing dynamics. Models are essential tools for strategic intelligence, aiding in framing, analysis, and synthesis. Target models represent areas of focus, showing component parts and their relationships. They are dynamic tools that must be updated with new intelligence.

Hierarchical models illustrate organizational structures or data hierarchies, identifying critical components and potential bottlenecks. They are useful for understanding data protection responsibilities within an organization.
