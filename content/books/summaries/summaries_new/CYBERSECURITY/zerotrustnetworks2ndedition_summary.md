**Zero Trust Networks, 2E Overview**

Zero Trust Networks, 2E advocates for a fundamental shift in network security, emphasizing that security should be integral to system operations rather than an add-on. The zero trust model assumes that no part of the network is inherently trustworthy. Each access request, whether from a client or server, is rigorously authenticated and authorized. This approach aims to eliminate issues like lateral movement and VPN complexities, representing the future of network security.

**Key Concepts and Structure**

**Zero Trust Fundamentals**

The zero trust model is built on five assertions: the network is always hostile, external and internal threats are constant, network locality isn't sufficient for trust, every element is authenticated and authorized, and policies are dynamic. Traditional perimeter-based security models are inadequate in the modern landscape due to their lack of intra-zone inspection and flexibility. Zero trust removes the need for VPNs and centralizes security control at the network edge.

**Zero Trust Architecture**

The zero trust architecture replaces traditional models with distributed policy enforcement. It uses a control plane to authenticate and authorize access requests, applying fine-grained policies based on various factors. The control plane dynamically configures the data plane for secure, temporary access, enhancing security and flexibility.

**Evolution and Conclusion**

The perimeter model, akin to physical security's castle-wall approach, is outdated in network contexts. Zero trust offers a more robust solution by treating all network elements as potentially compromised and focusing on continuous verification and dynamic policy enforcement.



The evolution of network security models began with the need for unique IP address assignments as networks expanded. Initially, Jon Postel managed IP address coordination, which later became the responsibility of the Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA). As IP adoption grew, the need for private IP address space emerged to prevent the depletion of public addresses. RFC 1597 introduced reserved IP ranges for private networks, enhancing security by isolating them from the internet.

As organizations sought internet connectivity, they faced security challenges. Initially, mail servers were the primary internet-connected devices, leading to the creation of the perimeter model. This model introduced the concept of a secure internal network and a demilitarized zone (DMZ) to control access. Firewalls were implemented to protect internal systems from internet threats.

Network Address Translation (NAT) further evolved the security model by allowing internal networks to access internet resources without exposing private IPs. NAT’s many-to-one mapping acted like a firewall, restricting inbound connections unless explicitly configured. This integration of NAT and firewall features became widespread, forming a standard security practice at organizational boundaries.

The perimeter model established clear security zones: the internal secure zone, the DMZ, and the untrusted internet zone. However, as networks became more interconnected, the threat landscape evolved. Attacks transitioned from dial-up interfaces to internet-based threats, with malware exploiting open ports and unprotected hosts. Hardware firewalls became essential to enforce security policies and block unauthorized access.

Despite these measures, the perimeter model faced limitations. The rise of Bring Your Own Device (BYOD) policies and remote work increased the attack surface, complicating patch management. Zero-click attacks, which exploit unpatched vulnerabilities without user interaction, highlighted the need for comprehensive security measures.

The perimeter model’s reliance on zone-based security policies proved flawed. Attackers could exploit weaknesses, gain access through compromised devices, and move laterally within networks. The model’s shortcomings became evident as attackers bypassed perimeter defenses using sophisticated techniques like remote access tools (RATs).

Overall, the perimeter model has been foundational in network security, but its limitations necessitate a shift towards more dynamic and adaptive security approaches. The need for robust outbound security measures and continuous patching is critical to mitigate modern threats. The evolution of network security continues as organizations adapt to an increasingly complex threat landscape.



The text discusses the vulnerabilities of traditional network security models and advocates for a shift to a zero trust architecture. In a typical attack scenario, hackers exploit outdated systems and inadequate security protocols to gain unauthorized access, highlighting the limitations of perimeter-based security. Despite meticulous firewall placement and scoped policies, breaches occur due to inherent weaknesses in the trust-based perimeter model, which assumes that internal networks can be trusted.

Zero trust architecture challenges this assumption by treating all network segments as potentially compromised. It emphasizes minimizing trust and assumes that threats can originate from within the network. This model requires robust authentication and authorization of users, devices, and applications, and mandates encryption of all communications, regardless of their location within the network. Automation plays a crucial role in dynamically updating security policies, ensuring that every network flow is authenticated and expected.

The zero trust approach is especially relevant in cloud environments where traditional network boundaries are blurred. By encrypting all data, operators can mitigate risks associated with shared infrastructure and ensure data confidentiality. This model also aligns with national cybersecurity initiatives, such as the United States Executive Order 14028, which calls for advancements in zero trust architecture to enhance security against sophisticated cyber threats.

Key components of zero trust include user/application and device authentication, authorization, and a computed "trust score" that determines access control. Network Access Control (NAC) technologies, while still useful, do not fully meet zero trust requirements due to their focus on network rather than service-level access. The zero trust model advocates for cryptographic identity verification, rendering IP addresses and physical locations less relevant for security purposes.

In summary, zero trust architecture redefines security by assuming a compromised network environment and implementing comprehensive measures to protect data and resources. It addresses the shortcomings of perimeter-based models by eliminating implicit trust and ensuring that all network interactions are secure and verifiable. This approach not only enhances security but also reduces cognitive load for developers by standardizing encryption practices across all network segments.



In zero trust networks, trust originates with the operator and is carefully managed through trust delegation. This process involves the operator assigning trust to systems, enabling automated actions like autoscaling. Trust chains form when a system trusted by the operator delegates trust to another system. The operator acts as a trust anchor, ensuring security and scalability with minimal human intervention.

Defining threat models is crucial for designing security architectures. They enumerate potential attackers, their capabilities, and targets, allowing for focused security efforts. Common threat modeling techniques include STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, Trike, VAST, and MITRE ATT&CK. These frameworks explore the threat space from different angles, such as asset-focused, component-focused, and attacker-focused approaches. Categorizing attackers helps prioritize mitigation efforts, from opportunistic attackers to state-level actors.

Threats and vulnerabilities differ; threats are potential negative events, while vulnerabilities are flaws enabling threats. Managing vulnerabilities involves tools like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) and Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE). Zero trust networks adhere to the internet threat model, which assumes control over communication channels but not end-system compromises. They focus on hardening systems and detecting compromises through device scanning and behavioral analysis.

Strong authentication is vital in zero trust networks, often utilizing X.509 certificates for identity verification. These certificates use public and private keys to authenticate identities without exposing secrets. Mutual TLS (mTLS) supports mutual authentication, ensuring both client and resource validation. Credential rotation is essential to minimize the impact of leaked keys, with frequent updates reducing risks.

Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) plays a crucial role in zero trust networks, allowing secure public key distribution and validation. PKI systems use a registration authority (RA) to bind identities to public keys, with certificate authorities (CAs) acting as trust anchors. CAs sign and publish certificates, enabling identity validation through trusted third parties. Protecting the CA is critical due to its privileged position.

PKI binds identities to public keys, while private keys are kept close to their entities, such as on smart cards or security chips. Automation is essential for managing the large number of certificates in zero trust networks, ensuring efficient and secure operations.



In the context of zero trust networks, managing Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) is crucial but complex. Public PKI, while widely used for X.509 certificates on the internet, is not ideal for zero trust environments due to cost, trust issues with numerous Certificate Authorities (CAs), and limited flexibility. Public PKI can be expensive due to fees from CAs, and trusting these authorities across various jurisdictions can be problematic. Furthermore, public CAs may not support programmability or allow embedding specific metadata, hindering automation and customization.

Despite these drawbacks, public PKI is better than having no PKI. Organizations can start with public PKI and transition to private PKI as risks grow, though automation remains necessary regardless of the choice.

The principle of least privilege is fundamental to zero trust, ensuring entities only have necessary permissions, reducing potential misuse. This applies to both users and applications, which should operate with minimal privileges and elevate only when necessary, often requiring additional authentication steps. Devices, too, are considered, as they often inherit user or application policies.

Dynamic trust management is essential, as static policies are insufficient against evolving threats. Traditional networks rely on manual policy assignments, creating trust pools that can be exploited by attackers targeting system administrators. Zero trust networks, however, use a trust score system, evaluating actions continuously to adjust access dynamically. This approach allows for granular access control based on activity attributes like time, location, and behavior.

Trust scores provide a flexible mechanism for defining access policies. They consider historical and current actions, akin to credit scores, and adjust based on risk. This dynamic model mitigates risks by requiring higher trust scores for sensitive actions and adapting to threats in real-time. Challenges include ensuring the trust score system is robust against manipulation and effectively communicating access restrictions to users.

Zero trust networks also distinguish between control and data planes. The data plane handles traffic, while the control plane manages configurations and policies. This separation allows for efficient traffic management and dynamic policy enforcement, enhancing security and adaptability.

Overall, zero trust networks emphasize dynamic, context-aware trust management, leveraging least privilege principles and trust scores to secure access and respond to threats effectively. This approach requires continuous monitoring and flexible policy frameworks to maintain a strong security posture in an ever-evolving threat landscape.



In a zero trust network, the separation of the control plane and data plane is crucial. The control plane handles requests from data plane devices wanting access to network resources, assessing risk and policy to determine trust levels. Trust is granted temporarily using leased access tokens or short-lifetime certificates, ensuring continuous validation. The interface between control and data planes must be secure, encrypted, and authenticated to prevent unauthorized lateral movement within the network.

A key concept in zero trust is least privilege, where components have minimal privileges, assuming the network is untrustworthy. This contrasts with traditional binary policy frameworks, which can be rigid or insecure. Instead, zero trust uses variable trust scores, allowing policies to adapt to new threats by considering the level of trust in components.

Context-aware agents are central to zero trust, combining user, device, and application data to form a comprehensive view of a request. This approach mitigates credential theft by evaluating the entire context rather than separate entities. Agents are ephemeral, changing with data updates, like user role changes or device unenrollment.

Agents include diverse data, such as trust scores, user roles, and device details. The trustworthiness of this data varies, with procurement-populated data being more reliable than device-reported data. Agents drive authorization decisions, emphasizing the combined context of user and device data, which simplifies policy writing.

Data co-location in agents clarifies request contexts, influencing authorization decisions. For example, a user accessing sensitive information from an untrusted device may be denied access, highlighting the importance of user-device relationships. Agents also contribute to trust score calculations, using recorded actions and agent data.

Agents are not involved in authentication; they are authorization components. Authentication occurs separately, often using X.509 certificates for devices and multifactor methods for users. Once authenticated, identifiers populate agent details. Authorization is request-oriented, not session-oriented, ensuring precise control over access.

Overall, zero trust networks require a dynamic, context-aware approach to security, focusing on minimal privilege, temporary trust, and comprehensive evaluation of user and device interactions to effectively manage threats and maintain network integrity.



In zero trust networks, authorization decisions rely on dynamic data from agents, which must remain current to ensure accurate access control. Caching authorization results is discouraged due to the rapid changes that can occur in agent data, unlike authentication materials that change less frequently. The process of generating agents should be efficient to encourage frequent requests.

Agents contain sensitive information, such as personal user details and device data, which must be protected. The entire lifecycle of an agent should be managed by secure control plane systems, distinct from data plane systems. These systems are responsible for making policy decisions but may need to expose some agent details to applications for fine-grained authorization. This can be achieved through trusted communication channels, such as headers in network requests via a reverse proxy.

Standardization of agent data formats is challenging due to the proprietary nature of the information they contain. However, existing protocols like SNMP offer a model for standardizing data formats using object identifiers (OIDs). Despite the lack of a private OID space, organizations can register for a Private Enterprise Number with IANA to create a dedicated OID prefix for internal use.

JWTs (JSON Web Tokens) are often used to share agent data securely, allowing for the inclusion of necessary fields in a compact format that can be signed and encrypted to ensure data integrity and confidentiality.

The zero trust authorization architecture includes four key components: enforcement, policy engine, trust engine, and data stores. These components must be isolated to prevent security breaches and ensure system availability. The enforcement component, often a load balancer or proxy, interacts with the policy engine to determine access permissions. The trust engine calculates risk scores to inform policy decisions, leveraging data from various sources.

Data stores serve as the source of truth, providing contextual information for authorization decisions. The enforcement component is crucial, acting as the frontline in authorization flows and carrying out decisions made by the policy engine. It should be placed close to endpoints to maintain security integrity.

Overall, zero trust networks require careful management of agent data and authorization architecture to ensure secure and efficient access control. While standardization efforts continue, flexibility and security remain paramount in implementing zero trust principles. 



In a zero trust network, authorization decisions rely on components such as the policy engine and enforcement layer. The policy engine makes dynamic, point-in-time decisions by comparing requests against stored policies to determine authorization. It is crucial to maintain process-level isolation between the policy engine and enforcement layer to prevent security risks. Policies are best stored in version control systems, enabling tracking of changes, rationales, and validation against enforcement mechanisms.

Zero trust policies differ from traditional network security by focusing on logical network components like services, device classes, and user roles, rather than physical network details. Policies must be dynamic to adapt to cloud environments, where applications scale rapidly. They should be fine-grained, defining access at the level of individual resources, and often include trust scores to anticipate unknown attack vectors. Trust scores, calculated by a trust engine, assess the riskiness of requests, using data from authoritative inventory systems and machine learning.

Policy definition is distributed across teams to manage complexity, with measures like policy reviews and layered infrastructure policies to mitigate risks from overly broad policies. The Kipling Method offers a framework for defining policies by considering who, what, when, where, why, and how access is granted. Despite the lack of industry-wide standards, organizations like the NCCoE are working towards standardization.

Machine learning in trust engines enhances risk assessment by deriving scoring functions from training data. These models evaluate attributes like IP addresses, user activity, and device information to detect anomalies. However, false positives can occur, requiring adjustments to improve accuracy. Trust engines typically use a combination of machine learning and explicit rules.

Scoring entities in a zero trust network involves considering users, devices, and network agents. Scoring should account for various scenarios, such as malicious activity or compromised devices. Ideally, both network agents and underlying entities are scored, allowing the policy engine to make informed authorization decisions. While exposing scores is not confidential, it must be managed carefully to avoid complexity and errors in policy crafting.



In zero trust networks, the display of trust scores to end users is discouraged to prevent potential attackers from gauging their impact on the system. A balanced approach is to show scores infrequently, highlighting factors affecting them. Data stores, crucial for authorization decisions, are categorized into inventory and historical types. Inventory stores, like user or device inventories, provide current state data, while historical stores, such as user records, support risk analysis. Trust engines use this data to calculate trust scores, influencing policy engine decisions.

Threat intelligence from sources like OSINT enhances trust score accuracy, especially in scenarios involving credential leaks. Compliance with regulations like GDPR affects policy engine decisions. Organizations maintain systems to automate compliance, often requiring human oversight.

A scenario involving Bob, a business manager, illustrates the zero trust model. Bob's access request to a file share is evaluated by a trust engine using a machine learning model. Anomalies in Bob’s activity logs lead to a low trust score, resulting in access denial by the policy engine. The policy engine applies rules based on compliance, trust scores, and default deny actions to ensure security.

The enforcement system executes the policy engine's decisions, ensuring they are implemented effectively. The policy engine, isolated and secure, computes authorization decisions based on defined policies and available data. The trust engine calculates trust scores, allowing policy writers to focus on resource access levels rather than specific actions. Authoritative data stores provide the necessary data for trust and policy engines, offering a return on investment through accurate decision-making.

In trusting devices within a zero trust network, bootstrapping trust involves loading a "golden image" to ensure software integrity. Secure boot processes validate software authenticity, while device certificates signed by a private certificate authority authenticate devices. Secure storage of private keys is crucial to prevent unauthorized access. These measures collectively strengthen device trust and authentication in the network.



In securing device keys, several methods are available, each with its own trade-offs. Storing keys with access restricted to privileged users, like administrators, is least secure as it risks exfiltration if access is compromised. Encrypting private keys provides better security, though it introduces usability challenges, particularly in server environments where human interaction for decryption is impractical. The most secure method involves using hardware security modules (HSMs) or trusted platform modules (TPMs), which perform cryptographic operations in a secure environment, preventing the private key from being accessed by the operating system.

For identity security, particularly in static systems, human involvement in provisioning and signing new certificates is common but becomes cumbersome as infrastructure scales. Automated systems can reduce this overhead, but careful consideration is needed to ensure the security of certificate generation. In sensitive environments, human intervention may be required for each certificate signing to prevent unauthorized requests. Time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs) offer a secure, low-overhead mechanism for human authorization in these processes.

In geopolitical contexts, certificate authorities (CAs) are affected by national laws, as seen during the Russo-Ukrainian war when Russia created its own CA due to sanctions. This highlights the importance of understanding the legal and political implications of relying on foreign CAs.

When automating provisioning, the resource manager plays a critical role in authorizing new certificates, akin to a human in static systems. Cloud providers offer built-in identity support, allowing resource managers to authenticate without credentials. However, relying solely on resource managers or credential-baked images poses risks. A combination of resource manager verification and TPM-backed devices enhances security by requiring multiple validation points, reducing the risk of unauthorized certificate requests.

X.509 certificates are crucial for device identity and authentication, supporting public key cryptography and enabling secure communications. They rely on certificate chains, where trusted CAs validate certificates, creating a trust chain. X.509 certificates contain vital information like the issuer, subject, and public key, and can include metadata for authorization decisions. Despite their utility, the security of X.509 relies on protecting private keys, often stored in HSMs to prevent exposure.

TPMs provide a hardware-based solution to bind private keys to devices, ensuring secure cryptographic operations without exposing keys to the operating system. This hardware binding is essential for true device identity in zero trust networks. TPMs generate a storage root key, securely storing cryptographic keys and operations, thus enhancing device authentication and security.

Overall, secure key management, careful certificate handling, and leveraging hardware security solutions like TPMs are vital for maintaining device identity and trust in both static and dynamic environments.



The text discusses the use of the Trusted Platform Module (TPM) for securing data and authenticating devices. The Storage Root Key (SRK) is a trust root for the TPM, used to encrypt small keys rather than bulk data due to the inefficiency of asymmetric encryption for large data volumes. A common approach is to encrypt data with a symmetric key (e.g., AES) and then encrypt this key with the SRK, ensuring that only the originating TPM can decrypt the key.

TPM libraries often use intermediary keys to add flexibility in data distribution, allowing additional passphrases. However, for cases where data should only be decryptable on the original device, bypassing intermediary keys is more efficient. A critical application of TPM is securing the device's X.509 private key, protecting it from being stolen and misused.

Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs) in TPMs store hashes of running software, ensuring the system is in an approved state. This enables "sealing" data, where it can only be decrypted by the TPM when PCR values match, locking data to specific software configurations.

Despite TPM's security, key theft is still possible if attackers can access the key from memory or misuse the TPM. Remote attestation using TPM's unique endorsement key (EK) allows verification of device identity and software state. However, TPM's limitations in usability and performance mean it is often supplemented with X.509 certificates for protocols like TLS.

TPM's role in zero trust networks is significant, providing strong authentication by linking software identity to hardware. However, challenges exist in virtualized environments, requiring TPM virtualization. TPM adoption is limited, and alternatives like Hardware Security Modules (HSMs) have similar attack vectors.

Recent attacks on HSMs and TPMs, like ROCA and Side-Channel attacks, exploit weaknesses in how endorsement keys are managed. Solutions include confidential computing and secure boot to protect data and ensure only trusted software runs on these devices.

For zero trust networks, legacy devices often use authentication proxies, but a hardware-based zero trust supplicant with a TPM chip is more secure. Inventory management is crucial for zero trust, cataloging devices to enforce policies. Configuration management systems can serve as inventory databases, setting expectations for device behavior and access control.

Client-facing systems pose challenges due to their unpredictable behavior. Mutually authenticated TLS can secure services by requiring device certificates, though it makes services globally reachable, posing security risks. Despite these challenges, TPMs and robust inventory management are key components in building secure zero trust networks.



Secure introduction is crucial for authenticating new devices to prevent unauthorized access. This process often involves a trusted third party to validate and introduce new systems. Key criteria for secure introduction include using single-use and short-lived credentials and leveraging third-party systems to separate duties and enhance security practices. An example is Chef's host introduction, which uses dynamic client certificates instead of static validation certificates, improving security by setting expectations for new clients.

Device trust must be renewed and measured over time, as prolonged operation increases the risk of compromise. Device rotation or reimaging are strategies to mitigate persistent threats, with reimaging being more feasible for cloud infrastructure than physical hardware. For client devices, rotation frequency impacts the required rigor of endpoint security.

Local measurement of device trust can be hardware-backed, like TPM for remote attestation, or software-backed, though the latter is less secure. Remote measurement, such as vulnerability scanning, benefits from separation of duty, reducing the risk of compromised hosts falsifying information. Unified Endpoint Management (UEM) systems play a vital role in maintaining device trust by enforcing security policies and monitoring compliance.

Continuous monitoring is essential to detect device behavior changes that may indicate a compromise. UEM systems enable remote actions like locking or wiping compromised devices. A process for cleaning and verifying compromised devices is more practical than replacing them, aligning with zero trust security principles.

The OpenID Foundation's Shared Signals and Events (SSE) Framework helps standardize status signal exchanges about device compliance changes. Configuration Management (CM) tightly controls software changes and provides security benefits like quick vulnerability patching. CM-based inventory management offers a rich data source, though it should be seen as a temporary solution due to its limitations.

In zero trust networks, a secure source of truth is vital, as self-reported data from devices can be unreliable. Critical attributes like device type, role, IP address, and public key should be asserted by a trusted provisioner. Device data can enhance user authorization by providing contextual knowledge for stronger authentication. For instance, verifying if user credentials match expected device types or issuance locations can prevent unauthorized access.

Overall, understanding secure introduction, device trust renewal, and leveraging configuration management are key to defending against attacks in a zero trust security model.



Zero trust architecture emphasizes dynamic trust evaluation based on various signals and context. A key aspect is user authentication, where anomalies like infrequent logins or sudden location changes can lower trust scores. Devices not seen for extended periods or accessing new resources may appear suspicious. Trust scores influence access levels, allowing partial access based on risk assessment.

Device trust is assessed through signals such as time since last image, historical access patterns, and network communication behavior. For instance, a device making unexpected network requests or showing altered communication patterns may be flagged as suspicious. Machine learning plays a role in identifying anomalous access patterns by analyzing historical data, though it's best used alongside other trust signals.

Device compliance with organizational standards—such as encryption and security updates—is crucial. Devices falling out of compliance due to missed checks may see their trust scores reduced. Activity logs are vital for detecting anomalies, capturing details like device ID, IP address, and geolocation.

A trust engine calculates trust scores for access requests using dynamic and static rules, considering factors like multi-factor authentication (MFA) usage and device compliance. The policy engine then uses these scores to make access decisions, often adopting a "deny all" approach unless explicitly permitted by rules.

In practical scenarios, trust scores guide access permissions. For example, a high trust score may allow printing documents, while a lower score might restrict email actions to read-only. This ensures productivity while limiting high-risk actions.

Overall, device trust management involves complex interactions between user behavior, device compliance, and network activity, with trust being dynamic and context-dependent. The system aims to start devices in a trusted state, managing the inevitable decline in trust over time through continuous evaluation and policy enforcement.



### Trusting Identities

In security systems, distinguishing between user and device trust is crucial. Devices often use X.509 certificates for identification, but this doesn't confirm the user's identity at the keyboard. With multiple devices per user, credentials risk exposure, necessitating unique credentials for different device capabilities.

**Identity Types:**

1. **Informal Identity:** Formed through repeated interactions, such as pseudonymous accounts in online communities. It works well in small, low-risk groups but is vulnerable to identity fabrication and theft.

2. **Authoritative Identity:** Created by a trusted authority, like government-issued IDs, which offer stronger identity verification. In computer systems, centralized authorities manage user credentials, with cross-checking for higher-risk scenarios.

**Identity Management:**

- **Recovery Mechanisms:** Systems must allow users to regain control of their identity if credentials are lost or stolen, using alternative verification methods like recovery codes.
  
- **Bootstrapping Identity:** Establishing a digital identity requires strong initial authentication to prevent unauthorized access. This often involves government-issued IDs and in-person verification to ensure authenticity.

- **Storing Identity:** Sensitive identity data must be securely stored. Centralized user directories facilitate authentication but pose privacy risks. Data should be segmented across isolated databases, accessed via constrained APIs.

**Authentication Strategies:**

- **Trust-Based Authentication:** Authentication is used to validate user identity, with varying strengths depending on the operation's sensitivity. Trust scores can dictate authentication requirements, enhancing security without burdening users unnecessarily.

- **Adaptive Authentication:** Instead of predefined sensitive actions, a trust score-driven approach dynamically adjusts authentication based on user trust levels, promoting a seamless user experience.

**Multi-Channel Authentication:**

- **Multiple Channels:** Using separate communication channels (e.g., one-time codes, push notifications) enhances security. The trust level of each channel should be evaluated to ensure effective authentication and authorization.

By understanding and implementing these identity and authentication principles, systems can maintain robust security while accommodating user convenience, essential in zero trust networks.



In a zero trust network, frequent validation of client authorization is crucial, often involving the control plane authorizing each request. This ensures adaptability to changes in trust levels. Common user authentication methods include:

1. **Knowledge-Based (Something You Know):** Passwords are prevalent but require strong, unique, and non-reused combinations. Password managers are recommended for managing complex passwords. Best practices involve storing cryptographic hashes rather than plaintext passwords.

2. **Possession-Based (Something You Have):** 
   - **TOTP:** Time-based one-time passwords require a shared secret and current time to generate codes. Ensuring secure storage of the shared key is vital.
   - **Certificates:** X.509 certificates, derived from private keys, offer rich details for authentication but depend on secure storage.
   - **Security Tokens:** Devices like smart cards generate private keys and perform cryptographic operations, providing strong identity assertions. They are often paired with other factors for enhanced security.

3. **Biometrics (Something You Are):** Utilizes physical characteristics such as fingerprints or facial recognition. While convenient, they pose challenges like potential spoofing and legal issues around compelled access.

4. **Behavioral Patterns:** Machine learning analyzes unique user behaviors for identity verification. This method adapts to behavioral changes but can be intrusive and less reliable over time.

**Out-of-Band Authentication** adds security by using separate channels, such as phone calls, to confirm actions, complicating unauthorized access.

**Single Sign-On (SSO)** centralizes authentication, reducing credential storage points and enhancing security. SSO tokens should be frequently validated to manage trust levels. Popular SSO protocols include:

- **SAML:** An XML-based standard for exchanging authentication data.
- **WS-Federation:** Used for negotiating token issuance.
- **Kerberos:** Scalable but complex, widely used in enterprises.
- **OAuth:** Simplifies authorization and supports SSO, though less effective on mobile.
- **OpenID Connect (OIDC):** Builds on OAuth 2.0 for identity verification.
- **CAS:** An open-source protocol for web and mobile SSO.

Overall, combining multiple authentication factors from different categories enhances security by diversifying attack vectors and increasing the difficulty of unauthorized access. Each method has its strengths and limitations, and the choice depends on the required trust level and specific use case. Authentication strategies should be continuously evaluated and updated in line with evolving security standards and technological advancements.



In a zero trust network, the control plane plays a crucial role in authentication systems. Workload identities are unique identifiers for software or service workloads, distinct from user identities, and their lifecycle should be automated and monitored. Cloud providers like AWS, Azure, and GKE support workload identities. SPIFFE is a framework for provisioning identities across environments, with SPIRE implementing these APIs for secure identity issuance.

Local authentication, extended to remote services, uses standards like FIDO UAF, which employs asymmetric cryptography to enhance security by shifting trust to user-controlled endpoints. This mitigates replay and man-in-the-middle attacks and eliminates credential reuse.

Group authentication can enhance security for sensitive actions. Shamir’s Secret Sharing distributes a secret among individuals, requiring a subset to reconstruct it. Cloudflare’s Red October uses layered cryptography for group access to encrypted data. The DNS Root Zone Signing Ceremony exemplifies group authentication, where multiple actors ensure DNSSEC trustworthiness.

In zero trust networks, users should actively participate in security. Collaboration and reporting suspicious activities improve security. Trust signals, like historical user activity, help determine user trustworthiness. Systems can use these signals to build behavior models and detect anomalies, employing methods like CAPTCHAs or geo-location checks.

A scenario involving Bob accessing a sensitive resource illustrates the process: Bob’s request is evaluated by a policy engine using trust scores derived from various factors, such as device compliance and MFA methods. Low trust scores can trigger additional requirements, like manager approval or stronger MFA.

Overall, identity management, authentication, and trust evaluation are key in zero trust networks. Establishing authoritative identity, balancing authentication, encouraging user vigilance, and leveraging activity logs are essential strategies. Future chapters will explore trust in applications, as software increasingly drives organizational operations.



Trusting the execution of code on a trusted device involves not only securing the device but also ensuring the trustworthiness of the code and its developers. Trust in code requires adherence to secure coding practices, vulnerability scanning, code signing, accurate processing, proper deployment, and continuous monitoring for updates and threats. This chapter explores securing these steps, emphasizing trust from development to execution.

The application pipeline, from development through build and distribution, is vulnerable to attacks. Securing each stage is akin to supply chain security, which involves protecting the integrity of products throughout production and distribution. Notable breaches, like the SolarWinds and 3CX incidents, highlight the importance of robust supply chain security in cybersecurity strategies.

A secure application build pipeline begins with source code in repositories like Git, followed by automated CI/CD processes. Code signing ensures integrity, while continuous monitoring detects security incidents. A Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) is crucial for managing software security and supply chain risks, as recommended by CISA and NIST.

The pipeline comprises four phases: source code, build/compilation, distribution, and execution. Trusting source code is challenging, especially with distributed version control systems (VCSs) like Git. Cryptographic techniques ensure immutability, but new commits must be authenticated. Signed commits and tags enhance authenticity and prevent impersonation.

Code reviews are essential for quality and security, requiring contributions to be approved by multiple developers. Build servers, automating code compilation and packaging, are critical but vulnerable to persistent threats. Protecting build systems involves ensuring trusted input and output, with signed artifacts and cryptographic hashes for validation.

Reproducible builds offer a powerful defense by ensuring identical binaries for given source code, allowing multiple parties to verify builds. This approach mitigates risks from compromised build systems and supports secure software deployment.



Reproducible builds ensure that binaries are identical byte-for-byte, providing a way to verify that the build process hasn't been tampered with. This involves a codified build process that allows developers to set up their environments to produce matching binaries, enabling detection of malicious interference. Virtualized environments, such as containers, help achieve this by isolating the build process from the host system.

Immutable builds are key to maintaining security, preventing the replacement of known good versions with compromised ones. This requires a separation between release versions and build artifact versions, ensuring that every version remains unchanged once published. The distribution system should map release versions to immutable build artifacts, preserving security without sacrificing usability.

In software distribution, integrity and authenticity are ensured through hashing and signing. Hashing validates that the software hasn't been altered, while signing ensures it was released by an authorized party. Systems like APT use these methods to secure distribution, with cryptographic signatures providing both integrity and authenticity.

Distribution networks often use mirrors to handle large-scale distribution. Trust in these networks relies on validating the Release file's signature, ensuring that mirrors faithfully replicate the original release. It's crucial to use TLS to protect against attacks on untrusted mirrors and ensure secure communication.

Supply chain integrity is vital, as demonstrated by attacks like SolarWinds. Frameworks like SLSA help automate and secure the software supply chain, ensuring that the integrity of source code analysis is maintained through to the binary. Human involvement should be limited to key points in the pipeline, with mechanisms for secure release certification.

Code signing is critical, as seen in the SolarWinds attack where compromised software was signed with a valid certificate. Organizations should use robust security measures, like code signing ceremonies, to protect signing keys.

Understanding the software running in infrastructure is crucial for zero trust networks. An upgrade-only policy prevents downgrades to vulnerable versions, and instances should be individually authorized to ensure they are up-to-date and secure. Secrets, such as API keys or certificates, can be used to authorize running applications.

Overall, a combination of reproducible builds, secure distribution practices, and robust supply chain integrity frameworks are essential to maintaining software security and trustworthiness.



In modern application deployment, managing secrets securely is crucial. Secrets, such as credentials, must be valid and have a defined lifetime to limit misuse. By generating unique secrets for each deployment instance, organizations can track and control application authorization more effectively. The deployment system should handle secret generation and injection, possibly using trusted third parties like HashiCorp's Vault, which can create and store secrets securely.

Runtime security involves ensuring that applications remain authorized and secure throughout their lifecycle. Secure coding practices are essential, as vulnerabilities often stem from exploitable bugs. Developers must adopt secure coding techniques, such as input validation and using secure APIs, to prevent injection attacks. Automated tools like static and dynamic code analysis can identify vulnerabilities in the source code and running applications, respectively. Fuzzing, a technique that tests applications with random data, can uncover unexpected errors and weaknesses.

Application isolation is another critical aspect of security, especially in zero trust networks. Isolation limits the resources an application can access, reducing the risk if an application is compromised. Technologies like SELinux, AppArmor, virtualization, and containerization (e.g., Docker, Kubernetes) provide varying levels of isolation. Virtualization offers strong security by creating a virtual hardware environment, while containerization is more resource-efficient but may offer less isolation.

Active monitoring and logging are vital for early attack detection. Traditional security models focus on external threats, but zero trust networks advocate for rigorous internal monitoring as well. Active monitoring can include continuous security scans and automated responses to detected threats, though caution is needed to avoid unintended disruptions.

Integrating security into the software development lifecycle (SDLC) is essential. Security requirements should be defined early, and secure coding practices must be followed. Tools like SAST and DAST help identify vulnerabilities during development. Peer reviews and code audits complement automated tools by catching issues they might miss. Security testing should be part of quality assurance, with penetration testing providing insights into potential vulnerabilities.

Once deployed, applications must be kept up-to-date with security patches. Monitoring and logging systems should detect and respond to security incidents promptly. Continuous improvement involves learning from incidents and updating security practices accordingly.

Confidential computing ensures data integrity and confidentiality, especially in public cloud environments. In zero trust contexts, cloud operators cannot be implicitly trusted. Confidential computing provides cryptographic proof that code and data remain secure and untampered during computation, even in potentially hostile environments.

By adopting these practices, organizations can enhance application security, foster a security-centric culture, and ensure the integrity and privacy of their applications and data.



Confidential computing ensures secure computation by using hardware-based Trusted Execution Environments (TEEs) to protect data in use. TEEs are secure environments combining hardware and software to execute only authorized applications, preventing unauthorized access or manipulation of data. This approach is distinct from other privacy-enhancing technologies like homomorphic encryption and zero-knowledge proofs due to its ability to verify untampered code execution.

A crucial component of confidential computing is the hardware-based root-of-trust (RoT), an immutable chip that provides tamper-resistant cryptographic key storage and supports hardware isolation, encryption, and attestation. Attestation verifies the integrity and authenticity of TEE hardware and software, ensuring they are unaltered and trusted. Major cloud providers offer built-in attestation features to enhance application security.

Despite its strengths, confidential computing is not immune to threats, necessitating thorough threat modeling. The Confidential Computing Consortium provides guidelines for evaluating potential risks.

In practice, confidential computing can be illustrated through scenarios like Bob's use case, where sensitive data is securely sent to a financial application running in a TEE. The process involves encryption, multi-factor authentication, and compliance checks to ensure data integrity and trustworthiness.

Zero trust networks emphasize securing applications by using a trusted application pipeline to transform source code into secure, deployable applications. This pipeline is a target for attackers, requiring secure practices in source code hosting, artifact distribution, and human oversight. Continuous monitoring and an upgrade-only policy help maintain application security over time.

Trusting network traffic in zero trust environments involves encryption and authentication to ensure confidentiality and integrity. Secure key management, forward secrecy, and multi-factor authentication bolster network trust. Post-quantum cryptography is being developed to address future quantum computing threats.

While encryption ensures confidentiality, it can complicate troubleshooting and intrusion detection. Therefore, it’s crucial to ensure data doesn't require confidentiality before opting out of encryption. Most protocols provide both encryption and authentication, making encryption a default choice.

The first packet problem in zero trust networks is addressed through pre-authentication, using methods like single-packet authorization (SPA) to set expectations for trusted connections. Tools like fwknop use SPA to create temporary, tightly scoped firewall exceptions, enhancing security without exposing resources unnecessarily.

Overall, confidential computing and zero trust principles work together to secure applications and network traffic, ensuring data protection and integrity in cloud environments.



**Encryption Modes**

Two encryption modes are supported: AES (symmetric) and GnuPG (asymmetric). AES is preferred for personal use due to its simplicity and performance, but it poses key distribution challenges at scale. GnuPG, though less performant, addresses these challenges and is recommended for larger applications.

**HMAC**

Fwknop can add an HMAC to its payload, ensuring message authenticity and preventing tampering. This is crucial as it mitigates certain attacks that exploit the authenticate-then-encrypt method. Using HMAC is advised because it allows lightweight integrity checks before decryption.

**Zero Trust Network Model**

Zero trust controls can be applied using TLS and IPsec. TLS is common at the application layer, while IPsec operates at the internet layer. IPsec offers secure host-to-host communication by establishing secure channels before packet transmission. It can use unique security associations per application, and filtering systems can enhance its security.

**IPsec Challenges**

IPsec faces challenges in network, device, and application support. Network issues include protocol transmission difficulties on some networks, such as AWS and public hotspots. Device support is hindered by the complexity of IPsec configurations and cipher suite agreements. Application support requires configuring IPsec policies and kernel support, which is more complex than TLS.

**Pragmatic Approach**

A pragmatic approach involves using mutually authenticated TLS for client/server interactions, which is simpler and widely supported. For server/server interactions, IPsec is preferable due to controlled configurations and known network environments. UDP encapsulation can mitigate network transit issues.

**Microsoft Server Isolation**

In Windows environments with Active Directory, server isolation uses Windows Firewall and Group Policy to automate IPsec configuration, offering fine-grained access control tied to security groups.

**Protocols**

IKE is a protocol for IPsec authentication and key exchange, typically implemented as a daemon. IKEv2 is recommended for new deployments due to its flexibility. IPsec is a suite of protocols, with IKE handling session negotiation and authentication.

**Mutually Authenticated TLS (mTLS)**

TLS, commonly used for web traffic, is mature and widely supported. mTLS requires client certificate validation, crucial for zero trust security. The TLS handshake involves exchanging compatibility lists and certificates, establishing a symmetric session key for encryption.

**Separation of Duty**

Separating encryption duties from the application enhances security and performance. Traditionally, applications handle TLS directly, but using a local TLS daemon offers better control and consistent performance.

**Bulk Encryption**

The TLS handshake, used for authentication and session key creation, is computationally expensive due to its mathematical operations.



Asymmetric cryptography is crucial for secure introduction and authentication, but it is computationally expensive. Symmetric encryption, using a single secret key, is more efficient for ongoing communication. The TLS handshake combines both methods, using asymmetric cryptography to establish a shared symmetric key for session encryption, ensuring security without performance drawbacks. AES is the recommended algorithm for bulk encryption due to its performance and security.

Message authenticity is vital for ensuring message integrity. Some encryption modes, like AES-GCM, provide both confidentiality and authenticity. TLS prefers built-in authenticity for bulk transfers and uses explicit checks for control messages. SHA family hashes are recommended for message integrity, with stronger variants preferred over SHA-1 due to vulnerabilities.

TLS, including its UDP variant DTLS, is widely used for device authentication. It requires additional automation for zero trust networks, where applications must reside on the same host as TLS intermediaries. Despite challenges, TLS remains a reliable choice for securing client-facing zero trust networks.

Trusting cloud traffic involves challenges like maintaining compliance, security, network visibility, understanding provider differences, and managing costs. Organizations can use multifactor authentication, vulnerability scans, and regular updates to mitigate risks. Zero trust principles, such as mutual authentication and access control, are essential for securing cloud environments.

Cloud Access Security Brokers (CASBs) enhance security by monitoring traffic and enforcing policies like data loss prevention and multifactor authentication. Identity federation, through services like SAML and OAuth, supports single sign-on, reducing unauthorized access risks.

Filtering, a critical component of zero trust architecture, is implemented at various network points. Host filtering empowers endpoints to manage their own security, while centralized filtering uses hardware firewalls for efficiency. On-host firewalls provide flexibility and can reduce attack surfaces, though they may be compromised if the host is attacked. Isolation techniques like virtualization can enhance on-host filtering security.

In summary, effective network security relies on a combination of encryption, authentication, and filtering strategies, with a focus on minimizing vulnerabilities and maintaining robust defenses across cloud and traditional environments.



In zero trust networks, filtering is essential for managing traffic and ensuring security. Filtering should not only occur on the host but also be distributed throughout the network. This approach mitigates risks such as denial-of-service attacks and improves system robustness. Bookended filtering, which applies rules to both incoming and outgoing traffic, is crucial. It provides an additional layer of protection by ensuring that even if ingress filtering is misconfigured, egress filtering can prevent unauthorized access.

Project Calico exemplifies a system that integrates these filtering principles. It dynamically configures host-based filtering and incorporates bookended filtering, enhancing network security by enforcing rules on both ends of a connection. This double-layered approach acts as a secondary defense mechanism.

Intermediary filtering involves devices other than the sender or receiver participating in traffic filtering. This includes perimeter filtering, which plays a significant role by filtering traffic at the network's edge. The perimeter filters should be a combination of global rules and host-specific policies, ensuring consistency and minimizing security risks.

Zero trust networks also leverage software-defined networking (SDN) to dynamically manage network traffic based on authentication and authorization processes. This reduces the attack surface and augments host-based security measures. The integration of host policies with network fabric allows for intelligent traffic management, ensuring only authorized flows are permitted.

In a zero trust scenario, policies are dynamic and continuously reviewed. For example, when Bob accesses an email service over a public network, his request undergoes stringent checks based on trust scores derived from device compliance and authentication methods. This ensures that access is granted based on current security policies, maintaining a balance between productivity and security.

To transition to a zero trust network, organizations must first understand their current network infrastructure. This involves mapping all network elements to identify vulnerabilities. The scope of implementing zero trust should be carefully chosen, considering the organization's size and complexity. Zero trust is not a one-size-fits-all solution but rather a set of principles tailored to specific needs, evolving as the network matures.

Ultimately, zero trust networks focus on authenticity and encryption, deploying packet-filtering capabilities throughout the network. They use a combination of host, bookended, and intermediary filtering to enhance security. The goal is to create a network that is resilient, adaptable, and secure against potential threats, while allowing for controlled access and operational efficiency.



Implementing a zero trust network involves a paradigm shift in security, focusing on "never trust, always verify." The process begins with assessment and planning, evaluating the current network, identifying assets, and conducting a gap analysis to transition to a zero trust architecture. This phase lays the foundation for continuous verification and least-privilege access, fostering a proactive security culture.

Key requirements for zero trust networks include:

- **Authentication:** All network flows must undergo authentication before processing, ensuring data provenance. This is crucial for zero trust compatibility.
- **Encryption:** Network flows should be encrypted before transmission to protect against physical and digital threats. Authentication and encryption must be performed by application-layer endpoints to prevent exposure to threats.
- **Flow Enumeration:** System access should be enforced by enumerating all network flows, defining expected characteristics to safeguard the network. This requires a distributed responsibility across the organization for defining flows.
- **Strong Suites:** The strongest authentication and encryption suites should be used, referring to standards like NIST for guidance.
- **Private PKI:** Authentication should not rely on public PKI providers due to risks associated with third-party trust. Private PKI systems are preferred.
- **Device Management:** Devices should be regularly scanned, patched, and rotated to maintain security, with a preference for reimaging over long-term scanning.

Building a zero trust network also involves creating a system diagram to visualize internal and external communications. Capturing network flows is essential for understanding existing connections and designing secure communication channels. Tools like Wireshark, Cisco Secure Network Analytics, and SolarWinds Network Performance Monitor can assist in logging flows and creating system diagrams.

Physical networks can use SPAN ports or TAP devices for monitoring, ensuring comprehensive visibility into network behavior. These steps are critical for implementing and managing zero trust networks, providing the necessary analytics to ensure secure operations.



In the context of network security, discovering logical flows is crucial for implementing a zero trust network. While virtualized networks can inspect traffic, they often lack granularity. Amazon Web Services offers flow logging, but tying this data to specific applications requires endpoint monitoring. Software firewalls in log-only mode can help discover flows without disrupting communication. For Linux, tools like those described in Harald Welte’s paper on flow-based accounting are useful.

Categorizing network flows based on logical connections rather than individual IPs or ports enhances security by allowing better enforcement and awareness of communication changes. Capturing all flows in a large network can be daunting, but transitioning to a zero trust model can be done incrementally, leveraging existing perimeter systems and spreading zone by zone.

Micro-segmentation, a key component of zero trust, divides networks into manageable zones, allowing precise control over interactions and data flows. This isolation helps mitigate threats by preventing breaches from spreading. As organizations adopt hybrid and multi-cloud architectures, micro-segmentation offers a structured security framework.

Software-defined perimeter (SDP) architecture creates isolated, on-demand networks resistant to attacks by requiring authentication and authorization before access. SDP restricts connections based on user, device, and service, contributing to zero trust implementation.

Configuration management tools can act as a temporary solution for zero trust networks by managing infrastructure configuration consistently and storing data in version control systems. These tools can automate tasks like configuring cryptographic primitives and managing firewall rules, serving as a stepping stone to a dedicated control plane.

Application authentication and authorization are crucial in a zero trust network. Instead of storing credentials in each application, integrating with identity providers like SAML or OAuth2 is recommended. Multifactor authentication enhances security, with security tokens preferred over time-based tokens.

Zero trust networks advocate for a control plane that injects authorization decisions into the network. In a scaled-down model, relationship-oriented policies define communication between devices using traditional mechanisms like firewalls and TLS, focusing on device-level security rather than network segments.

Policy distribution in zero trust networks requires automation. Configuration management systems can dynamically configure devices for enforcement, creating a virtual control plane. However, this approach risks policy alteration if hosts are compromised. Policies should be captured separately for auditing and ease of transition between systems.

Testing security policies is essential. A "log then enforce" procedure allows for safe policy implementation, gradually enforcing policies and identifying issues without disrupting production systems. Zero trust proxies, deployed as infrastructure, handle authentication, authorization, and encryption, operating in reverse or forward proxy modes to secure network connections.

Overall, transitioning to a zero trust network involves strategic planning, leveraging existing tools, and gradually implementing policies to enhance security while maintaining operational integrity.



In building a zero trust network, proxies should be deployed on the same device as the workload to ensure all communication is routed through the proxy. This approach is preferred over placing proxies on dedicated devices, which could compromise the model by leaving traffic between proxies and backend services unprotected. Zero trust proxies are particularly useful for securing vendor-supplied components that cannot be modified, by isolating them through an authentication proxy.

When transitioning to a zero trust network, organizations must decide whether to start with client-to-server or server-to-server interactions. Client-to-server interactions often involve mobile devices accessing services from uncontrolled networks, making them a high-value focus. However, these devices are diverse, requiring compatible automation systems. Server-to-server interactions are usually less diverse and already equipped with automation tools, making them an easier target for initial zero trust implementation, especially as they often house sensitive data.

A structured approach to implementing zero trust involves identifying priority areas, conducting threat modeling, allocating resources strategically, and iteratively implementing zero trust principles. Continuous monitoring and adaptation are essential to respond to evolving threats.

Endpoint security is critical in a zero trust network, requiring strong authentication, regular patching, and endpoint detection and response (EDR) solutions. Enforcing the principle of least privilege minimizes access risks. For example, employees might not have admin rights on company laptops, requiring IT approval for certain actions.

Case studies, such as Google’s BeyondCorp, illustrate successful zero trust implementations. Google redesigned its security model to eliminate reliance on a privileged corporate network, focusing on device and user credentials for access. BeyondCorp uses a Device Inventory Database and device certificates to manage device identity, while a User Database and single sign-on (SSO) system manage user authentication. An Access Proxy (AP) enforces encryption and access control, using an Access Control Engine to dynamically assess trust levels based on device and user data.

The AP integrates with Google’s identity provider to authenticate users, supporting various authentication protocols. This centralized approach allows for scalable and flexible access control, ensuring secure access to enterprise resources without relying on traditional VPN connections. The model emphasizes fine-grained access control, allowing employees to work securely from any network location.

By leveraging centralized policy enforcement, Google’s BeyondCorp offers a blueprint for organizations to move away from perimeter-based security models, focusing instead on continuous validation of trust through device and user credentials.



In Google's BeyondCorp model, user authentication is managed by the Access Proxy (AP), which strips credentials before sending requests to backends. This ensures that backends can't replay requests and can implement their own authentication flows. The authorization mechanism relies on a centralized access control list (ACL) engine, allowing consistent policy enforcement across multiple gateways. Mutual authentication between the proxy and backend is crucial, achieved through Google's Low Overhead Authentication System (LOAS), which encrypts communication and ensures metadata integrity.

Device identification is critical, requiring a unique device identifier and an inventory database. Desktops use X.509 certificates, while mobile devices rely on native identifiers. Migration to BeyondCorp involves phased transitions from a privileged network to an unprivileged one, resembling external networks but within a private address space. Applications undergo qualification to ensure compatibility with the AP, reducing VPN reliance.

Traffic analysis and simulation help ensure workflows are available in the unprivileged network. A phased migration strategy involves identifying candidates based on job function, operating a simulator in logging and enforcement modes, and handling exemptions for non-qualified workflows. Effective communication is vital to avoid user confusion and operational strain during migration.

Challenges include ensuring data quality and correlation, as poor data can lead to access issues. Solutions involve workflow improvements and automated validation to maintain high data accuracy, which also enhances security by ensuring devices are updated with the latest patches.

PagerDuty's zero trust network, built in a cloud-agnostic environment, uses configuration management tools like Chef to automate policy enforcement across its infrastructure. This approach scales with the network, isolates failures, and ensures consistent policy application. However, it requires constant validation and has limitations, prompting a transition to dedicated systems for long-term solutions. PagerDuty's system relies on dynamically calculated local firewalls, ensuring each host is secured independently of provider systems.



PagerDuty's network security is structured around a zero trust model, categorizing servers by role to define communication patterns and access. Each server role is identical in configuration, using IPtables to whitelist expected flows, dropping packets that don't match predefined rules. This approach ensures only authorized communications occur.

PagerDuty implemented an IPsec host-to-host mesh network for encryption and authentication, distributing these functions across the system. This decision was made to avoid the complexities and security pitfalls of application-level encryption. IPsec, encapsulated in UDP packets due to cloud provider constraints, ensures all packets are encrypted and authenticated, enhancing security as the network grows. Initial deployment faced communication failures, but these were isolated to specific host pairs, minimizing impact.

Decentralized user management is employed, avoiding reliance on a centralized LDAP system. Instead, users and groups are programmatically constructed on each host, using Chef data bags for definitions. This ensures continued operation even during network challenges.

PagerDuty's transition to a zero trust network involved a slow rollout strategy, minimizing risk by gradually enabling policies and monitoring their impact. This method was applied to both firewall and IPsec configurations, ensuring that changes did not disrupt production traffic. The phased approach allowed for safe transitions between different IPsec policy states, reducing potential risks.

The provider-agnostic nature of PagerDuty's network facilitated a seamless transition between cloud providers, demonstrating significant ROI. This adaptability was achieved through careful planning and automation, reducing the typical high-risk change windows associated with such migrations.

The adversarial view chapter highlights potential pitfalls of zero trust models, emphasizing the need for robust authentication measures to prevent credential theft and privilege escalation. Attack vectors such as social engineering, DDoS, and zero-day vulnerabilities are explored, along with countermeasures like multifactor authentication and continuous monitoring.

Identity and access threats, particularly credential theft and privilege escalation, are critical concerns. Protecting identity secrets and employing trust engine behavioral analysis are key strategies to mitigate these risks. The zero trust model inherently raises the security bar by requiring authentication of both device and user/application, though careful handling of identity remains crucial.

Overall, the text provides a detailed examination of PagerDuty's zero trust implementation, the challenges faced, and strategies employed to maintain robust security in a dynamic network environment.



In a cybersecurity scenario involving a fictional company, Bases Loaded, Inc. (BSL), an attacker gains initial access to the cloud environment through a phishing attack. The attacker sends a deceptive email to an employee, Alex, who unknowingly provides their credentials by logging into a fake portal. With these credentials, the attacker accesses Alex’s cloud account and discovers administrative privileges. Exploiting these privileges, the attacker escalates access and breaches another administrative account linked to BSL’s Azure Active Directory.

The attacker leverages the hybrid setup of BSL’s infrastructure, which synchronizes on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD, to move laterally into the on-premises network. Compromising the Active Directory allows the attacker potential access to sensitive data and critical infrastructure. BSL could have mitigated this risk through security awareness training, implementing multi-factor authentication, using cloud-only accounts for administration, and conducting regular security audits.

Infrastructure and networks are foundational in IT, facilitating connectivity and data management but also presenting security challenges. Control plane security is crucial, as it manages access and permissions across systems. A compromised control plane can lead to unauthorized access, service disruption, and regulatory non-compliance. Ensuring the security of these systems involves rigorous controls, limited network connectivity, and administrative isolation.

Zero trust networks, which do not rely on a perimeter, face unique challenges such as endpoint enumeration, where adversaries can map system interactions. While zero trust ensures confidentiality, it does not guarantee privacy. Mitigating threats like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks requires additional strategies. Zero trust networks can leverage insights to automate traffic filtering and enforce stateless rules, but these solutions are better suited for large networks.

Invalidation in zero trust networks deals with revoking previously authorized actions. It involves balancing security with the practicality of reauthorization processes. Strategies include granular authorizations, periodic session resets, and tracking ongoing actions to reauthorize them dynamically. Although a push or event-based model for invalidation is ideal, it presents complexities.

Overall, addressing these cybersecurity challenges involves a combination of awareness, robust authentication, and strategic network management to minimize risks and enhance security posture.



Zero trust networks face challenges from social engineering and physical coercion. For less sensitive resources, behavioral analysis and user training are key defenses. For critical assets, group authentication schemes like Shamir’s Secret Sharing are effective but burdensome. Physical threats, such as coercion at border crossings or through physical force, require strategies that minimize the risk of compromise by a single individual. Regular device and credential cycling, along with scanning unrotated devices, can mitigate physical access threats.

Cyber insurance provides financial protection against cyber incidents, offering a safety net and regulatory compliance. However, it often excludes vulnerabilities caused by human error. Insurance pricing is based on revenue and industry, often requiring security audits.

Zero trust networks aim to protect resources by assuming breaches and enforcing least privilege access. They employ a dynamic, session-based access policy and monitor resources continuously. The architecture involves core components like the policy engine, policy administrator, and policy enforcement point, which work together to manage access decisions.

The U.S. government has been proactive in adopting zero trust, with Executive Order 14028 mandating its implementation across federal agencies. This involves developing a zero trust architecture plan, guided by NIST and DoD standards, to enhance cybersecurity by 2024. Key scenarios include secure access for federal staff, device monitoring, encrypted network traffic, and secure application testing.

NIST’s zero trust architecture (ZTA) framework emphasizes resource protection without implicit trust. It involves core components like the policy engine, which makes access decisions, and the policy enforcement point, which manages connections. These components ensure that access is continually evaluated and adjusted based on threats.

Zero trust frameworks and guidelines from various governments, including the U.S., U.K., and others, provide foundational knowledge for implementing zero trust. These guidelines are crucial for organizations transitioning from perimeter-based security models to a zero trust approach, which is more effective in today’s interconnected digital landscape.

The shift to zero trust is driven by technological advances, increasing the attack surface for malicious actors. Organizations are adopting zero trust to strengthen security, with Gartner predicting significant adoption by 2026. The approach is seen as a scalable and secure solution, replacing traditional perimeter models.

Overall, zero trust aims to minimize uncertainty in access decisions, enforce precise access, and protect all computing services. It is a comprehensive security strategy that addresses both virtual and physical threats, supported by evolving standards and frameworks.



Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) is a security model that assumes no implicit trust and requires verification for access requests. Key components include Policy Enforcement Points (PEP), Policy Decision Points (PDP), and Policy Administrators (PA), which collectively manage access control. Subjects, which can be users or non-human entities like applications, interact with systems that verify identity and enforce access policies.

Enterprise resources, such as applications and networks, can be located on-premises, in the cloud, or hybrid. ZTA distinguishes between trusted and untrusted environments, with the former requiring ongoing verification and the latter allowing some degree of implicit trust. Data sources like Continuous Diagnostics and Mitigation (CDM), Threat Intelligence, and Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems support decision-making by providing real-time data and insights.

Deployment models of ZTA vary based on enterprise needs and include:

1. **Device Agent/Gateway-Based Deployment**: Involves agents on devices and resource gateways. Pros include suitability for robust asset management; cons include challenges with BYOD scenarios.

2. **Enclave Gateway Model**: Places a gateway at the boundary of a resource enclave. Pros include suitability for legacy systems; cons involve potential for unauthorized reconnaissance.

3. **Resource Portal-Based Deployment**: Uses a single gateway for access requests, beneficial for BYOD but lacking full asset visibility.

4. **Device Application Sandboxing**: Runs approved applications in isolated environments, offering protection against malware but requiring maintenance of sandboxed apps.

The Trust Algorithm (TA) is central to ZTA, evaluating access requests using data sources like subject databases and threat intelligence. It can use criteria-based or score/confidence level approaches for evaluating inputs and singular or contextual approaches for access requests. The criteria-based approach is straightforward but less flexible, while the score-based approach is adaptive but requires tuning.

Potential threats to ZTA include subversion of decision processes, DoS attacks, stolen credentials, and reliance on proprietary solutions. Mitigation strategies involve monitoring, auditing, and using open standards to ensure interoperability and resilience.

The National Cybersecurity Center of Excellence (NCCoE) provides guidance on implementing ZTA, collaborating with industry to develop standards-based solutions. Their project "Implementing a Zero Trust Architecture" offers practical examples and is documented in the NIST SP 1800 series, aimed at decision-makers and IT professionals.

Overall, ZTA emphasizes continuous verification, leveraging diverse data sources to make informed access decisions, and adapting to evolving threats through flexible deployment models and robust policy frameworks.



The document "Approach, Architecture, and Security Characteristics" (SP-1800) provides a comprehensive guide on Zero Trust Architecture (ZTA) approaches using various commercial vendors. It maps vendor products to a logical ZTA and outlines the required physical architecture, primarily for large and medium enterprises, excluding industrial control systems (ICSs) and operational technology (OT). Other related drafts, such as "How-To Guides" (SP-1800-35C), offer instructions for constructing reference implementations with vendor documentation, while "Functional Demonstrations" (SP-1800-35D) describe ZTA use cases and scenarios.

The "Risk and Compliance Management" document (SP-1800-35E) maps ZTA components to security characteristics in NIST publications like SP 800-53r5 and NIST CSF 1.1, focusing on security and privacy controls. The Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) Zero Trust Maturity Model aids government agencies in implementing zero trust, aligning with DoD/NSA pillars: Identity, Devices, Networks, Applications, and Data. It emphasizes cross-cutting capabilities like visibility, automation, and governance.

CISA’s maturity model progresses from traditional to optimal levels, enhancing security, automation, and interoperability. The Department of Defense (DoD) Zero Trust Reference Architecture defines seven pillars: User, Device, Network, Application, Data, Visibility, and Automation, emphasizing principles like identity-based authentication and continuous monitoring. The DoD’s strategy includes a roadmap for zero trust capability progression and a digital library for further resources.

The National Security Agency (NSA) publication "Embracing a Zero Trust Security Model" outlines zero trust benefits, a maturity model, and implementation challenges, advocating for gradual transition. The NSA emphasizes principles like "never trust, always verify" and suggests starting with early planning and progressing through maturity levels.

The United Kingdom's National Cyber Security Centre provides zero trust architecture design principles for public and private sectors, focusing on key tenets and policy application. The EU Directive 2022/2555 emphasizes zero trust principles in cybersecurity practices, advocating for their adoption alongside other measures.

Private and public organizations like the Cloud Security Alliance (CSA) and The Open Group offer publications on zero trust, including best practices, integration with Software-Defined Perimeters (SDP), and core principles. Gartner also provides research and consulting on zero trust strategies.

Quantum computing, in particular, challenges current cryptographic methods, necessitating adaptation to maintain security.

Overall, zero trust is a dynamic field requiring continuous adaptation and alignment with emerging technologies and organizational needs. Organizations must carefully navigate these challenges to effectively implement and benefit from zero trust security models.



Quantum computing poses a significant threat to current cryptographic methods like RSA, as algorithms such as Shor's can solve complex mathematical problems rapidly. This impacts data confidentiality, especially for organizations with long-term data storage requirements. Post-quantum cryptography (PQC) and quantum key distribution (QKD) are being developed to counter these threats. PQC offers quantum-resistant cryptographic schemes without requiring quantum mechanics, while QKD uses quantum principles for secure key distribution. Both are expected to coexist, with PQC being more accessible due to its software-based nature.

Artificial intelligence (AI) is crucial in cybersecurity, offering capabilities like zero-day attack detection and data classification. However, AI also presents risks, such as deepfakes and data privacy concerns. Responsible AI use is essential to ensure ethical and secure implementations. AI models must be interpretable to provide reliable outcomes, and feedback loops can reduce false positives. Additionally, AI models are vulnerable to adversarial attacks and data poisoning, which can compromise their effectiveness.

Privacy-enhancing technologies (PETs) are vital in a zero trust environment, ensuring data protection at rest, in transit, and during use. These include homomorphic encryption, which allows computations on encrypted data, and confidential computing, which secures data within a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). Secure multiparty computation (SMPC) and zero-knowledge proofs (ZKP) enable collaborative data processing without exposing sensitive information.

Organizations face challenges in adopting zero trust security, such as overcoming shadow IT and siloed operations. Evaluating numerous vendors and managing scalability issues also complicate implementation. Monitoring technological advancements like quantum computing, AI, and PETs is crucial for maintaining a robust cybersecurity posture.
