## Foundations

Part I introduces the command line, bash shell, regular expressions, and fundamental cybersecurity principles. The command-line interface is highlighted as a crucial skill for security practitioners, offering speed and flexibility over GUIs.

## Command-Line Primer

The command line allows interaction with the OS's capabilities, essential for tools like Metasploit and Nmap. The book covers over 40 commands spanning Linux and Windows, emphasizing the bash shell for scripting due to its cross-platform nature.

## Command-Line Illustrations

Examples demonstrate command-line usage, with Git Bash being the preferred method on Windows. Other methods include Cygwin, Windows Subsystem for Linux (WSL), and PowerShell.

## Running Linux and Bash on Windows

Options for running Linux commands on Windows include Git Bash, Cygwin, WSL, and PowerShell. Each has unique features, such as Git Bash's ability to run native Windows commands.

## Command-Line Basics

The command line involves executing commands, which can be files, built-ins, or keywords. Commands have options and arguments, with built-ins and keywords offering efficiency. Standard input/output/error and redirection techniques are also covered.

The book aims to provide a comprehensive understanding of command-line interfaces and bash scripting to enhance cybersecurity capabilities.



In command-line operations, input and output redirection is crucial. Standard input (stdin), output (stdout), and error (stderr) have file descriptors: 0, 1, and 2, respectively. Redirection uses these descriptors to manage data flow. For example, `handywork 2> err.msgs` redirects stderr to a file, while `handywork < data.in > results.out 2> &1` combines stderr with stdout. The shorthand `&>` achieves this efficiently. To discard output, direct it to `/dev/null`.

To view and save output simultaneously, use `tee`, as in `handywork < data.in | tee results.out`. Appending to files is done with `>>`, preserving existing content. Running commands in the background allows multitasking, using `&` to continue using the shell. For instance, `ping 192.168.10.56 > ping.log &` sends `ping` to the background. Use `jobs` to list background tasks and `fg` to bring them to the foreground. Suspend a process with `Ctrl-Z` and continue it with `bg`.

A shell script is a file containing command-line commands, executable with `bash myscript` or directly after setting execute permissions. The shebang (`#!/bin/bash`) specifies the interpreter, and `#!/usr/bin/env bash` ensures portability.

Bash is versatile, functioning as both a command-line interface and a programming language. It supports variables, conditionals, and loops. Variables are strings by default, assigned with `MYVAR=value` and accessed with `$MYVAR`. Use quotes to preserve whitespace. Command output can be stored with `$(command)`. Positional parameters in scripts are accessed with `$1`, `$2`, etc., and `$#` gives the count.

For user input, use `read`, and for output, `echo` or `printf`. Conditionals in bash utilize `if`, evaluating command success with `$?`. Comparisons use `[[ ]]` for file attributes and numeric tests (`-eq`, `-gt`, `-lt`). Inside `(( ))`, numerical logic applies, treating nonzero as true.

Commands can be chained with `&&` (execute if previous succeeds) or `||` (execute if previous fails). This flexibility enhances script functionality, enabling complex tasks and efficient workflow management.



## Bash Scripting and Pattern Matching

### Conditional Statements

- **Tests Using `[[` Syntax**: 
  - `[[ -d $DIR ]] && ls "$DIR"` is equivalent to:
    bash
    if [[ -d $DIR ]]; then
      ls "$DIR"
    fi
    
  - Use braces `{}` to group multiple statements when using `&&` or `||`.

### Looping Constructs

- **While Loop**:
  - Execute commands while a condition is true.
  - Example:
    bash
    i=0
    while (( i < 1000 )); do
      echo $i
      let i++
    done
    

- **For Loop**:
  - Iterate over a list of items or parameters.
  - Example:
    bash
    for ((i=0; i < 100; i++)); do
      echo $i
    done
    

### Functions

- **Defining Functions**:
  - Use `function myfun() {}` syntax.
  - Variables are global unless declared local.
  - Functions can take arguments like shell scripts (`$1`, `$2`, etc.).

- **Returning Values**:
  - Return a status (0 for success, non-zero for errors).
  - Use output redirection to capture function results.

### Pattern Matching

- **Wildcards**:
  - `*` matches any number of characters.
  - `?` matches a single character.
  - `[abc]` matches any character in the set.

- **Character Classes**:
  - Examples include `[:alnum:]` for alphanumeric and `[:digit:]` for digits.
  - Use within square brackets, e.g., `[[:digit:]]`.

### Writing Scripts

- **Example Script (osdetect.sh)**:
  - Detects the operating system by checking specific commands.
  - Uses `type` to determine command existence.

### Regular Expressions

- **Usage**:
  - Regular expressions are used in commands like `grep`, `awk`, and `sed`.
  - In bash, regex is valid with `=~` in `[[ ]]`.

### Grep Command

- **Options**:
  - `-c`: Count matching lines.
  - `-i`: Ignore case.
  - `-R`: Recursively search directories.

- **Example Usage**:
  - Search for a pattern in files:
    bash
    grep -R -i 'password' /home
    

### Summary

- Bash scripting includes control structures, loops, functions, and pattern matching.
- Regular expressions are essential for text processing.
- The `grep` command is a powerful tool for searching text using regex patterns.

### Workshop Exercises

1. Experiment with `uname` for OS detection.
2. Modify scripts to use functions.
3. Set script permissions to executable.
4. Write a script (`argcnt.sh`) to count and display script arguments.

Regular expressions and bash scripting are foundational tools for effective command-line operations and automation.



### Summary

The text provides a detailed explanation of regular expressions (regex) and their usage in command-line tools like `grep` and `egrep`. It highlights the power of regex metacharacters and their role in pattern matching.

#### Grep Variations
- **Grep**: Supports regex patterns with special characters.
- **Egrep**: Equivalent to `grep -E`, supports extended syntax without needing backslashes for metacharacters like `?`, `+`, `{`, `|`, `(`, `)`.

#### Key Metacharacters
- **`.` (Dot)**: Matches any single character except a newline.
- **`?` (Question Mark)**: Makes the preceding item optional, matching it zero or one time.
- **`*` (Asterisk)**: Matches the preceding item zero or more times.
- **`+` (Plus)**: Matches the preceding item one or more times.

#### Grouping and Alternation
- **Parentheses `()`**: Used to group characters and apply operators to the entire group.
- **Pipe `|`**: Acts as a logical OR within grouped patterns.

#### Character Classes
- **Brackets `[]`**: Define a set of characters to match.
- **Ranges**: Specify a range of characters, e.g., `[a-z]`.
- **Predefined Classes**: Shortcuts like `\d` for digits, `\w` for word characters, available with `grep -P`.

#### Quantifiers
- Use curly braces `{}` to specify the number of times an item must appear, e.g., `T{3}` for exactly three T's.

#### Anchors and Boundaries
- **`^`**: Anchors a pattern to the start of a line.
- **`$`**: Anchors a pattern to the end of a line.
- **`\b`**: Denotes a word boundary.

#### Back References
- Allow matching of previously matched groups using `\1`, `\2`, etc.

#### Practical Applications
- Regex is used in data validation, searching, and processing. It is crucial in cybersecurity for pattern detection and analysis.

#### Cybersecurity Principles
- **Confidentiality**: Ensuring only authorized access.
- **Integrity**: Maintaining data accuracy and consistency.
- **Availability**: Ensuring data is accessible when needed.
- **Nonrepudiation**: Linking actions to responsible entities.
- **Authentication**: Verifying user identity.

#### Attack Life Cycle
- Describes the systematic approach used by advanced adversaries in cyber operations.

The text outlines the Attack Life Cycle, a sequence of steps typically followed in offensive cybersecurity operations. The cycle includes:

1. **Reconnaissance**: Gathering information about the target network, users, and potential vulnerabilities. This can be passive (e.g., packet sniffing) or active (e.g., port scanning).

2. **Initial Exploitation**: Exploiting vulnerabilities to gain access to the system using techniques like SQL injection or phishing.

3. **Establish Foothold**: Ensuring persistent access by creating new users, enabling remote access, or installing malware.

4. **Escalate Privileges**: Gaining higher-level access to perform tasks restricted to privileged users, often through exploiting vulnerabilities or stealing credentials.

5. **Internal Reconnaissance**: Mapping the internal network using the gained access to refine the attack strategy.

6. **Lateral Movement**: Moving across the network to access critical systems, using techniques like credential theft or exploiting vulnerabilities in other hosts.

7. **Maintain Presence**: Using techniques like beaconing for periodic communication with a command-and-control server to avoid detection.

8. **Complete Mission**: Achieving the attack's goal, often involving data exfiltration, while masking this activity as normal network traffic.

The text also discusses defensive security operations, emphasizing the importance of data collection, processing, and analysis. Key data types include logfiles, command history, temporary files, user data, browser history, and the Windows Registry. 

Linux logfiles are typically stored in `/var/log/`, while Windows logs can be managed using `wevtutil`. Commands like `cut`, `file`, and `head` in Linux, and `reg` and `wevtutil` in Windows, are used for data extraction and analysis.

Remote data collection can be performed using SSH to execute commands on remote systems. The text provides examples of using these tools to gather system information, emphasizing the need for understanding system states to defend against attacks.

Overall, the text highlights the cyclical nature of cyber attacks and the importance of comprehensive data management in cybersecurity operations.



# Summary

## Script Overview

The `winlogs.sh` script is designed for gathering Windows log files using Bash. It supports an optional `-z` flag to compress the logs into a TAR file and allows specifying a directory for storing logs. It utilizes `wevtutil` to list and export logs, making filename adjustments to ensure compatibility with Bash.

## Script Functionality

1. **Initialization**: Sets a flag (`TGZ`) to determine if logs should be compressed.
2. **Argument Handling**: Uses `$#` to check for arguments. Supports `-z` for compression and a directory path for storing logs.
3. **Directory Management**: Creates a directory using `mkdir -p` and changes to it with `cd`.
4. **Log Collection**: Uses `wevtutil el` to list logs and `wevtutil epl` to export them, replacing spaces and slashes in filenames.
5. **Compression**: If `-z` is set, compresses logs using `tar -czvf`.

## System Information Gathering

The `getlocal.sh` script collects system information using standard OS commands, storing output in XML format. It adapts to Linux or Windows environments by determining the OS type with `osdetect.sh`.

### Key Features

- **Command Execution**: Reads commands from `cmds.txt`, separates them for Linux and Windows, and executes the appropriate one.
- **Output Formatting**: Wraps command outputs in XML tags for structured storage.
- **Error Handling**: Redirects both standard output and error streams to a file.

## Windows Registry and Filesystem Search

### Registry Export

- Uses `regedit` to export the entire Windows Registry to a file.
- Supports exporting specific sections with `reg export`.

### Filesystem Search

- Utilizes `find` and `grep` for searching files by name or attributes.
- Supports searching for hidden files using patterns and attributes.

#### Examples

- **Filename Search**: `find /home -name '*password*'` searches for files containing "password".
- **Hidden Files**: `find /home -name '.*'` finds hidden files on Linux. On Windows, `dir c:\ /S /A:H` lists hidden files.

### Advanced Search Commands

- Uses `find -exec` with `attrib` to identify hidden files on Windows, allowing complex searches with command execution for each file found.

## Conclusion

These scripts and commands provide robust tools for system information gathering, log file management, registry export, and filesystem search, crucial for cybersecurity operations and forensic investigations.



### Summary

The text provides a detailed guide on using command-line tools for file management and system searching, focusing on specific attributes such as hidden files, file size, modification time, content, file type, and message digest values.

#### Hidden Files
To identify files with the hidden attribute, use a regular expression with `egrep` and `cut` to display only the file paths. Example command:

bash
find . -exec attrib '{}' \; | egrep '^.{4}H.*' | cut -c22-


#### File Size
The `find` command with the `-size` option helps locate files based on size. To find files larger than 5 GB in `/home`:

bash
find /home -size +5G


To identify the largest files, combine `find` with `ls`, `sort`, and `head`:

bash
find / -type f -exec ls -s '{}' \; | sort -n -r | head -5


#### Time-Based Search
Files can be searched based on their last access or modification times. For files modified less than 5 minutes ago in `/home`:

bash
find /home -mmin -5


For files modified more than 2 days ago:

bash
find /home -mtime +2


#### Content Search
To search for files containing specific content, use `grep`. For files with the string "password" in `/home`:

bash
grep -i -r /home -e 'password'


#### File Type
The `file` command helps identify file types by analyzing file contents. To find PNG files:

bash
find / -type f -exec file '{}' \; | egrep 'PNG'


A script example, `typesearch.sh`, automates this process, allowing recursive searches and copying found files to a specified directory.

#### Message Digest Search
Hash functions like SHA-1 can identify files regardless of name or location. Using `sha1sum`, calculate the hash of files and compare them to a known digest. A script, `hashsearch.sh`, facilitates this search:

bash
#!/bin/bash
HASH=$1
DIR=${2:-.}
find $DIR -type f | while read fn; do
  THISONE=$(sha1sum "$fn")
  THISONE=${THISONE%% *}
  if [[ $THISONE == $HASH ]]; then
    echo $fn
  fi
done


This comprehensive guide demonstrates the use of command-line tools to efficiently manage and search files based on various criteria, providing valuable techniques for system administration and cybersecurity operations.

# Summary

## Real-Time Log Monitoring with Bash Scripts

### wintail.sh
The `wintail.sh` script emulates the Unix `tail` command for Windows logs using `wevtutil`. It continuously monitors a specified Windows log and prints new entries by comparing the latest log entry with the last one displayed. Key parameters include:
- `c:1`: Returns only one log entry.
- `rd:true`: Reads the most recent log entry.
- `f:text`: Returns results in plain text.

### Real-Time Histogram Generation
To count lines added to a file over a time interval, two scripts are used:
1. **looper.sh**: Counts lines in a file using a `tail -f` command. It responds to a `SIGUSR1` signal by printing the count and resetting it.
2. **tailcount.sh**: Sends `SIGUSR1` signals to `looper.sh` at intervals, triggering it to report the line count.

The `trap` command is used to handle signals, and `shopt -s lastpipe` ensures the `while` loop runs in the main process, crucial for signal handling.

### livebar.sh
This script reads input from `tailcount.sh` and prints a horizontal bar chart of live data. It dynamically rescales if input values exceed a set maximum, ensuring readability.

## Network Monitoring Tool

### Requirements
A bash script is developed to monitor open ports across a network:
1. Reads IP addresses or hostnames from a file.
2. Performs a port scan (TCP ports 1-1023) for each host.
3. Saves results with a timestamped filename.
4. Compares new results with previous scans and highlights changes.
5. Automates daily runs, alerting administrators via email if changes are detected.
