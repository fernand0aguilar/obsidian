## Summary

### IP Address Space and Early Internet

The evolution of the perimeter model began with address assignment during the early internet era, where networks were increasingly interconnected. Unique IP addresses were necessary to avoid overlaps, especially for internet-connected networks. The Internet Assigned Numbers Authority (IANA), established in 1998, coordinated IP address assignments to ensure global uniqueness. Before IANA, Jon Postel managed this responsibility.

### Introduction of Private IP Address Space

As IP adoption grew in the late 1980s and early 1990s, the misuse of address space became a concern. RFC 1597, introduced in 1994, reserved three IP ranges for private networks (10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, 192.168.0.0/16), preventing address depletion and enhancing security by isolating networks from the internet.

### Connecting Private Networks to the Internet

Organizations sought internet connectivity for services like email, leading to the establishment of a demilitarized zone (DMZ) where external hosts could interact with internal networks. This setup necessitated firewalls to protect internal systems, birthing the perimeter model.

### Birth of NAT

To facilitate internet access for internal networks, Network Address Translation (NAT) was introduced. NAT allowed private networks to access internet resources by mapping public IPs to private ones, integrating with firewalls to ensure security.

### Contemporary Perimeter Model

The perimeter model evolved with firewalls/NAT devices creating distinct security zones: internal, DMZ, and untrusted (internet). Organizations interconnected through similar security setups, balancing security with business needs.

### Evolution of the Threat Landscape

Initially, attacks targeted dial-in interfaces over telephone networks. With internet-connected hosts, attacks shifted online, leading to the rise of software Trojan horses. Firewalls provided protection by enforcing traffic policies, limiting both inbound and outbound connections.

### Challenges and Security Measures

NAT's introduction relaxed outbound security, allowing internal hosts to communicate with untrusted internet hosts, facilitating attacks like "phoning home." Modern attacks often involve compromising a single host and moving laterally within the network. The rise of BYOD (Bring Your Own Device) expanded the attack surface, complicating patch management.

### Zero-Click Attacks

Zero-click attacks exploit vulnerabilities without user interaction, targeting unpatched devices. These sophisticated attacks emphasize the need for timely security patches.

### Perimeter Model Shortcomings

Despite its prevalence, the perimeter model is flawed. Successful attacks bypass perimeter defenses, moving laterally within networks. The reliance on zone-based security policies and exceptions creates vulnerabilities. Attackers exploit these weaknesses, often through social engineering and malware, to gain unauthorized access.

### Conclusion

The traditional perimeter model, while foundational, faces significant challenges in contemporary cybersecurity. As threats evolve, so must security strategies, emphasizing the need for comprehensive, adaptable measures beyond perimeter defenses.



The text outlines the limitations of traditional perimeter security models and advocates for a Zero Trust approach to network security. In a typical breach scenario, attackers exploit vulnerabilities by targeting individuals through phishing, escalating privileges, and accessing sensitive data. Despite robust perimeter defenses, such attacks are common because perimeter security often fails to address internal threats.

**Zero Trust Fundamentals:**
Zero Trust assumes that threats are present both outside and within the network. Unlike perimeter models that differentiate between trusted internal networks and untrusted external ones, Zero Trust treats all network segments as potentially compromised. This model requires strict verification for every access attempt, regardless of its origin.

**Key Components of Zero Trust:**
1. **Authentication and Authorization:** Both users and devices must be authenticated and authorized, ensuring that only verified entities can access resources.
2. **Automation:** Automation is crucial for maintaining dynamic security policies and configurations. It allows for real-time updates and enforcement, which are essential for a Zero Trust environment.
3. **Encryption:** Strong encryption is mandatory for all communications, ensuring confidentiality and integrity even within the same data center.

**Perimeter vs. Zero Trust:**
The perimeter model attempts to create a boundary between trusted and untrusted zones, but this approach is flawed as it assumes internal safety. Zero Trust, however, assumes that attackers can already access the network and focuses on securing individual elements through rigorous identity verification and encryption.

**Implementation in the Cloud:**
Zero Trust is particularly suitable for cloud environments, where network security cannot rely on physical boundaries. It eliminates the need for traditional VPNs by ensuring that all data is encrypted and secure, regardless of its path.

**National and Global Adoption:**
Governments, including the United States and the United Kingdom, are adopting Zero Trust principles to enhance cybersecurity. This shift is driven by increased cyber threats and the need for more reliable security frameworks.

**Conclusion:**
The text highlights the necessity of transitioning from perimeter-based security to Zero Trust networks, emphasizing the importance of automation, encryption, and comprehensive authentication. As network environments evolve, especially with the rise of cloud computing, Zero Trust offers a more resilient and adaptable security model.




### Summary

In a zero trust network, trust originates from the operator and is carefully managed and delegated. Trust chains are formed when an operator delegates trust to systems, which can then trust others, enabling automated and scalable systems with minimal human intervention. This is crucial for operations like autoscaling, where systems must validate new servers as legitimate.

**Threat Models** are essential in designing security architectures, focusing on potential attackers, their capabilities, and intended targets. They help prioritize security efforts by addressing simpler threats first. Common threat modeling techniques include STRIDE, DREAD, PASTA, Trike, VAST, and MITRE ATT&CK. These models help enumerate threats and mitigating systems, often blending different approaches for a comprehensive strategy.

Attackers are categorized by capability: opportunistic attackers, targeted attackers, insider threats, trusted insiders, and state-level actors. Zero trust networks aim to defend against threats up to the trusted insider level, acknowledging that defending against state-level actors is often impractical due to their vast resources.

**Threats vs. Vulnerabilities**: A threat is a potential negative event, while a vulnerability is a flaw that allows a threat to be realized. Managing vulnerabilities is critical, with resources like the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS), Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE), and National Vulnerability Database (NVD) aiding in this process.

Zero trust networks expand on the internet threat model by considering endpoint compromises. They focus on hardening systems against compromised peers and detecting compromises through device scanning and behavioral analysis. Frequent software updates and credential rotations are key mitigation strategies.

**Strong Authentication** is vital in zero trust networks, where traditional methods like IP addresses and passwords are insufficient. X.509 certificates are widely used, enabling identity verification through a chain of trust. TLS (Transport Layer Security) supports mutual authentication, ensuring both client and server validation.

Certificate-based authentication relies on public and private keys, with public keys distributed and private keys kept secret. To enhance security, multiple secrets stored in different locations are used, and credential rotation is crucial to limit the impact of stolen keys.

**Public Key Infrastructure (PKI)** is fundamental for securely distributing and validating public keys. It enables unprivileged participants to authenticate peers through a mutual third party. Certificate authorities (CAs) act as trust anchors, signing and publishing public keys and identities. Protecting the CA is critical as its compromise would be catastrophic.

PKI is integral to zero trust networks, proving identity across devices, users, and applications. Automation is necessary due to the volume of certificates, reducing the need for human intervention in certificate signing processes.

In summary, zero trust networks emphasize careful trust management, strong authentication, and robust threat modeling to secure systems against common adversaries, while recognizing the limitations against state-level actors.



### Public vs. Private PKI in Zero Trust Networks

Public PKI systems, commonly used on the public internet, have strengths like established utilities and peer-reviewed security practices. However, they pose challenges in zero trust networks due to high costs, trust issues with numerous Certificate Authorities (CAs), and limited flexibility for storing site-specific metadata. Despite these drawbacks, public PKI is better than no PKI, and organizations can transition to private PKI when risks increase.

### Principle of Least Privilege

The principle of least privilege ensures entities have only necessary permissions, reducing misuse potential. In applications, this means running under restricted accounts. For humans, it involves policies like limiting source code access to engineers. Devices should follow similar policies. Encryption for privacy is an extension of least privilege, ensuring access to sensitive data is limited and temporary.

### Human-Driven Authentication

Sensitive operations may require multiple human verifications, adding a layer of security against compromised systems. Applications and devices should also have minimal necessary privileges. Zero trust networks dynamically adjust privileges based on user, application, and device interactions, mitigating risks from compromised credentials.

### Dynamic Trust and Trust Scores

Managing trust is complex in secure networks. Traditional networks rely on static policies, which can lead to privilege escalation and security vulnerabilities. Zero trust networks use dynamic trust scores, continually assessing user actions to determine access levels. This approach allows for granular access decisions based on risk factors like time, location, and behavior.

### Monitoring and Policy Adjustments

In zero trust networks, encrypted traffic limits traditional inspection methods. Trust is built through strong authentication and policy-based trust scores. These scores enhance security by allowing flexible access decisions. However, challenges include ensuring trust scores accurately reflect security needs and communicating access restrictions to users effectively.

### Control Plane vs. Data Plane

The zero trust network architecture distinguishes between the control plane and data plane. The data plane handles network traffic, while the control plane manages configurations and security policies. This separation ensures efficient traffic management and adaptable security controls.



In a zero trust network, a clear separation between the control plane and data plane is essential. The control plane processes requests from data plane devices to access network resources, while the data plane consists of applications, firewalls, proxies, and routers that handle network traffic. The interface between these planes must be secure to prevent privilege escalation and lateral movement within the network. Communication between the planes should be encrypted and authenticated using a nonpublic PKI system, resembling the user/kernel space interface to prevent privilege escalation.

The control plane acts as the trust grantor for the network, requiring a highly privileged role to make trust decisions. Trust should be temporary, with regular check-ins using leased access tokens or short-lifetime certificates. This ensures that if the factors influencing an initial trust decision change, access can be revoked, reducing the risk of attacks.

Zero trust networks require strong authentication, often achieved through PKI, to assert identity validity. The concept of least privilege is crucial, ensuring components have minimal permissions. The model of variable trust, where trust is a numeric value, allows for flexible policy definitions that adapt to novel threats.

Agents in zero trust networks combine user, device, and application data to drive policy decisions. This approach mitigates credential theft by considering the entire context of a request. Agents are ephemeral, formed on demand, and their data can change rapidly, reflecting changes in user roles or device status. Trust scores, a dynamic data field within agents, are updated in real-time to mitigate active attacks.

Agents are used in authorization, not authentication. Authentication occurs separately for users and devices, often using certificates or multifactor approaches. Once authenticated, agents are formed using canonical identifiers for authorization decisions. This ensures that policy considers the complete context of user and device interactions.

In summary, zero trust networks emphasize managing trust through secure interfaces, temporary trust, strong authentication, least privilege, and context-aware agents. These principles help maintain security in a network assumed to be hostile, adapting policies to evolving threats and ensuring minimal privileges for network components.



### Summary

In a zero trust network, the concept of an "agent" is crucial for making authorization decisions. Agents contain rapidly changing and potentially sensitive data, such as personally identifiable information and device details. This data should be managed carefully to protect privacy and security, and should be contained within trusted control plane systems. These systems are physically and logically separated from data plane systems to maintain security.

Caching authorization decisions is discouraged due to the dynamic nature of agent data. Instead, authorization should use the latest data, unlike authentication, which changes less frequently. If access needs to be revoked, updating authorization is more effective than changing authentication credentials because authentication results are often cached.

Agents are primarily used for authorization, not authentication. The control plane systems use agents to authorize requests, but sometimes need to expose agent details to applications for fine-grained authorization. This can be done through a trusted communication channel, such as injecting headers into network requests via a reverse proxy.

Standardization of agent data formats is desirable but challenging due to proprietary information. However, existing standards like SNMP offer a model for organizing data. Agents should be flexible and easily extensible, using formats like JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) for data exchange.

The zero trust authorization architecture comprises four main components: enforcement, policy engine, trust engine, and data stores. These components should be isolated from each other to prevent breaches and ensure security. The enforcement component interacts with the policy engine to make authorization decisions and should be placed close to endpoints to avoid trust pooling.

The policy engine uses the trust engine, which computes a risk score based on multiple data sources, to inform decisions. Data stores provide the source of truth for user and device data, essential for contextualizing requests.

Overall, the integration of agents into a zero trust network enhances security by making authorization decisions based on up-to-date, context-aware information. While standardization efforts are ongoing, flexibility in data handling remains important for implementation. The next steps involve focusing on the systems responsible for authorizing requests in a zero trust network. 



### Summary

In a zero trust network, the architecture involves key components like the policy engine, enforcement layer, and policy storage, each playing a crucial role in authorization decisions. The **policy engine** is responsible for making authorization decisions by comparing requests against defined policies. It operates independently from the enforcement layer to ensure security and rapid decision-making, though they can be co-located for lower latency. This setup allows for fine-grained authorization, such as authorizing individual HTTP requests instead of broader session-level authorizations.

**Policy storage** is crucial for maintaining and tracking policy rules, ideally through a version control system. This approach allows for tracking changes, understanding the rationale behind changes, and validating current policies against enforcement mechanisms. Moving policy definitions into version control aligns with change management procedures, enabling programmatic configuration and standard software development practices for policy management.

**Good policy** in a zero trust network is fine-grained and defined by logical components rather than network details like IP addresses. This approach supports dynamic scaling, as seen in cloud environments where applications can rapidly scale up or down. Policies must adapt to these changes, being defined independently from specific network implementations.

The **trust engine** assesses risk by analyzing requests and actions, providing a numeric risk score used by the policy engine for authorization decisions. It leverages data from authoritative systems and may use machine learning to derive scoring functions. Machine learning helps evaluate anomalous patterns, though it must be balanced with explicit rules to handle unexpected attacks.

**Policy definition** is often distributed across teams to manage the burden of maintaining fine-grained policies. Version control and policy reviews help ensure well-considered changes, while broad infrastructure policies enforce overarching constraints. The Kipling Method provides a framework for defining resource access policies, considering who, what, when, where, why, and how access is granted.

In terms of **trust scoring**, both network agents and underlying entities like devices and users should be scored to address various threat scenarios. This dual approach allows the policy engine to make informed authorization decisions based on multiple scores, though it complicates policy crafting. Ideally, a single score would suffice, but this requires a more complex, interactive trust engine design.

Overall, zero trust networks require a balance of dynamic, fine-grained policies and robust risk assessment mechanisms to secure network activities effectively. Efforts are ongoing to standardize zero trust policies, with organizations like the NCCoE contributing to this development.




In zero trust systems, revealing user scores can signal attackers about their trust levels, which should be balanced against user frustration over not understanding score impacts. A compromise is to show scores infrequently and highlight score factors. Data stores in these systems serve as sources of truth for current and past states, informing authorization decisions. They are categorized into inventory (current state) and historical (risk analysis) data stores. Inventory stores use primary keys like usernames for users or serial numbers for devices, while historical stores assist in risk assessment and trust score calculations.

Threat intelligence, including data from breaches, helps trust engines determine trust scores, impacting policy engine decisions. Compliance standards like GDPR influence these decisions, with systems maintaining versioned compliance policies. A scenario involving a user named Bob illustrates the zero trust components. Bob's request to access a resource is evaluated by the policy engine using trust scores and compliance rules. The policy engine applies rules based on office hours, device security updates, and trust scores, defaulting to deny if no rules apply.

The control plane includes enforcement, resources, and users. Bob's request, made from an unusual location, receives a low trust score due to anomalies, leading to denial. The enforcement component communicates denial reasons, aiding user understanding. The system evaluates requests based on context rather than ad hoc decisions.

The chapter outlines four key systems: enforcement, policy engine, trust engine, and data stores. The enforcement system implements policy decisions, while the policy engine computes these decisions based on available data and policies. The trust engine calculates trust scores using algorithms based on past behavior. Authoritative data sources provide current and historical data for decision-making.

In the scenario, Bob's request is denied due to a low trust score, despite compliance with other rules. The walkthrough demonstrates the interaction of control and data plane components in authorization decisions. Future chapters will explore how devices gain and maintain trust.

Trusting devices in zero trust networks is crucial but challenging. Devices often become compromised, leading to security breaches. Systems must establish and maintain device trust. Bootstrapping trust involves loading known good images onto devices, ensuring software integrity. Secure boot processes validate software signatures to prevent tampering. Devices identify themselves using unique certificates signed by a private certificate authority, linking them to inventory data for decision-making.

Securing private keys associated with device certificates is vital to prevent unauthorized access. Theft of these keys poses significant security risks. Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of trust, compliance, and secure management in zero trust systems.



In the context of securing device keys, the most secure method involves using hardware security modules (HSMs) or trusted platform modules (TPMs). These secure cryptoprocessors perform cryptographic operations within a protected environment, ensuring that private keys never leave the module, thus minimizing the risk of theft. While encrypting private keys is an improvement over simple permissions, it introduces usability issues, especially in server deployments where human interaction is required for key decryption upon software restarts.

In static systems, human involvement in provisioning and signing certificates is common but becomes challenging as infrastructure scales. Automation can streamline this process, though it raises concerns about unauthorized certificate generation. A balance can be achieved by involving humans in authorizing signing requests, supplemented by security measures like time-based one-time passwords (TOTPs), which provide control with minimal overhead.

Geopolitical tensions can impact the trust in certificate authorities (CAs), as seen during the Russo-Ukrainian war when Russia offered its own CA due to sanctions affecting certificate renewals. This highlights the influence of laws on CAs and the potential challenges they pose.

For automated systems, trust in certificate signing can be sourced from a human, a resource manager, or the device/image itself. Resource managers, akin to humans in static systems, manage infrastructure scaling and can authorize certificate signing. However, relying solely on a resource manager or embedding credentials in images is risky. A multifaceted approach involving a registered TPM key, correct IP address, valid TOTP, and expected certificate properties enhances security.

X.509 certificates are crucial for device authentication, defining public key certificates and enabling encrypted communication. A certificate's trustworthiness depends on its endorsement by a CA, forming a verifiable chain. The X.509 framework facilitates secure device authentication across protocols, but its efficacy hinges on protecting the private key. HSMs and TPMs offer robust solutions by securely storing private keys and performing cryptographic operations without exposing them to the operating system.

TPMs, embedded cryptoprocessors, provide secure cryptographic operations and bind private keys to hardware, addressing a critical aspect of device identity in zero trust networks. By ensuring that private keys remain hardware-bound, TPMs enhance the security of device authentication frameworks like X.509, mitigating risks associated with software-based private keys.

Overall, leveraging HSMs and TPMs, alongside careful automation and human oversight, strengthens the security and trustworthiness of device authentication processes in both static and dynamic systems.



## Summary

The text discusses the role of Trusted Platform Modules (TPMs) in securing devices, focusing on encryption, device authentication, and the challenges associated with TPMs and Hardware Security Modules (HSMs).

### Key Concepts

1. **TPM and SRK**: The Storage Root Key (SRK) is the trust root for TPM devices. Asymmetric encryption, while expensive for bulk data, is used to secure symmetric keys (like AES keys) for efficient data encryption. This ensures that only the original TPM can decrypt the AES key.

2. **Intermediary Keys**: TPM libraries often create intermediary keys to encrypt data. These keys provide flexibility in data distribution and support passphrases. However, bypassing them can be more efficient for certain deployments.

3. **X.509 Private Key Protection**: TPMs are crucial for protecting X.509 private keys, which verify device identity. Encrypting these keys with TPMs prevents recovery without the original hardware, although key theft remains possible through privileged access.

4. **Platform Configuration Registers (PCRs)**: PCRs store hashes of running software, ensuring systems remain in an approved state. Sealing data with TPMs ensures it can only be decrypted when PCR values match specific configurations.

5. **Remote Attestation**: TPMs use endorsement keys (EKs) for unique identification. Remote attestation involves generating a "quote" with current PCR values, signed with the EK, to verify host identity and software state.

6. **TPM Limitations**: While TPMs are ideal for strong authentication in zero trust networks, they are limited by cumbersome access and sparse support. Virtual environments require TPM virtualization, and designing secure systems with TPMs is challenging.

### Security Concerns and Solutions

1. **Attack Vectors**: Recent attacks on TPMs and HSMs, such as ROCA, Side-Channel, and Fault Injection, exploit vulnerabilities in key management. These attacks highlight the need for enhanced security measures.

2. **Confidential Computing and Secure Boot**: These techniques protect data by encrypting it during storage and processing, and ensure only trusted software runs on TPMs and HSMs.

3. **Best Practices**: Regular updates, reputable vendors, audits, and robust physical and logical security measures are recommended to safeguard TPMs and HSMs.

### Zero Trust Networks and Inventory Management

1. **Hardware-Based Zero Trust**: Using dedicated hardware devices with TPM chips can enhance security for legacy systems by acting as zero trust supplicants.

2. **Inventory Management**: Cataloging device properties is crucial for policy enforcement in zero trust models. Configuration management systems can serve as inventory databases, helping set expectations for device behavior.

3. **Client and Server Differentiation**: Servers often have predictable connections, allowing for strict access control. Client systems, however, require a more flexible approach due to their dynamic nature.

Overall, TPMs play a critical role in device security, but their implementation and management come with challenges that require careful consideration and robust security strategies.



### Secure Introduction and Device Trust

Secure introduction is crucial for establishing trust between new devices and existing systems. It involves a trusted third party that authenticates the initial connection. This process ensures that only trusted devices are introduced to the network, often using methods like TOTP codes for authorization. A secure introduction system must meet three criteria: use single-use credentials, have short-lived credentials, and involve a third party to prevent poor security practices.

### Client Systems and Pre-authentication

Introducing client-facing systems securely is challenging due to unpredictable client behavior. Pre-authentication is a widely accepted method, signaling a client's intentions before taking action. This reduces risks associated with publicly exposing endpoints.

### Renewing and Measuring Device Trust

Security is never perfect, and device trust must be continuously renewed. Device age is a significant trust signal, and rotation or reimaging helps maintain security. Reimaging is effective in removing persistent threats but may not address hardware attacks. For client devices, reimaging is inconvenient, requiring a balance between security and user convenience.

### Local and Remote Measurement

Device trust can be measured locally or remotely. Local measurement can be hardware-backed, using TPM for remote attestation, or software-backed, with agents reporting health and state. However, software-backed measurements are less secure. Remote measurement benefits from separation of duty, often using vulnerability scans to assess device health.

### Unified Endpoint Management (UEM)

UEM systems manage device security from a centralized console, enforcing security policies and monitoring compliance. They can remotely lock or wipe compromised devices, ensuring data confidentiality. Continuous monitoring and quick responses to compromises are crucial.

### Configuration Management

Configuration management involves controlling and documenting software changes, using tools like Chef, Puppet, and Ansible. It provides security benefits by enabling quick updates and auditing. CM systems can also act as inventory management systems, offering searchable data for audits and policy configuration.

### Device Data for User Authorization

In a zero trust model, both device and user authentication are essential. Device authentication precedes user authentication, providing contextual knowledge for stronger user authorization. This can prevent unauthorized access by verifying expected user behavior based on device data.

### Conclusion

Device trust is a critical aspect of zero trust security. Understanding secure introduction, continuous trust renewal, and effective measurement methods enhances an organization's defense against attacks. Leveraging configuration management and UEM systems supports a robust security posture.



## Summary

This chapter delves into the complexities of establishing trust in devices within a zero trust architecture. It emphasizes the importance of a robust inventory management database, which aids in user and device authentication. Trust signals are vital for calculating device trust scores and crafting policies. These signals include:

1. **Time Since Image**: Over time, the likelihood of device compromise increases. Imaging a device ensures its contents match a known good state, providing assurance of trust. However, this trust diminishes as the device is exposed to potential risks.

2. **Historical Access**: Device authentication patterns help assess risk. Unusual access patterns, such as a device suddenly accessing new resources or overutilizing a resource, are flagged as suspicious.

3. **Location**: While zero trust models aim to minimize reliance on network location, sudden changes in location can still provide useful trust signals. However, decisions should not be based solely on location data.

4. **Network Communication Patterns**: Changes in network behavior, like a device suddenly making unusual connections, can indicate potential threats. Monitoring these patterns helps in maintaining device trust.

5. **Machine Learning**: Machine learning models analyze the context of access requests, identifying anomalies by considering user, device, and historical activity. While effective, it should be used alongside other trust signals for optimal results.

The chapter also explores a scenario walkthrough, illustrating how device trust is evaluated using Bob's authorization requests. Data from device stores, activity logs, and user identity information are used by a trust engine to calculate trust scores. These scores are then used by a policy engine to make authorization decisions, ensuring security while maintaining user productivity.

For example, when Bob requests to print a document, his device's compliance status, use of MFA, and consistent historical access patterns result in a high trust score, allowing the request. Conversely, when Bob wants to delete an email, a lower trust score due to the device's compliance check timing restricts his access to read-only.

The chapter concludes by discussing the dynamic nature of trust, which degrades over time. Various technologies, such as X.509 and TPMs, are highlighted for authenticating devices, alongside mechanisms for renewing and managing trust. The overarching lesson is that a device starts in a trusted state, but this trust must be actively maintained and reassessed over time.



### Summary of Trusting Identities

In the realm of cybersecurity, distinguishing between user trust and device trust is crucial. While organizations might use X.509 certificates to enhance device security, this does not inherently verify the user's identity. The increasing use of multiple devices by users complicates credential management and security. Zero trust networks emphasize separating user and device identities, using distinct credentials for each.

#### Identity Authority

Every user has an identity within a system, which can be informal or authoritative. Informal identity develops through interactions and is common in online communities, but it has vulnerabilities like identity fabrication or sharing. For higher security, authoritative identities are necessary, often issued by a centralized authority like a government. In digital systems, similar centralized identity management is required, with mechanisms for users to regain control if credentials are lost or stolen.

#### Bootstrapping Identity

Creating a digital identity involves securely linking it to a real-world person. This process, known as bootstrapping, requires strong authentication to prevent impersonation. Government-issued IDs are recommended for human authentication due to their reliability. Physical presence during identity creation is preferred to avoid vulnerabilities associated with remote methods.

#### Storing Identity

User identity data must be stored securely, often in centralized directories, to support authentication. Such directories contain sensitive information, necessitating careful management and segmentation to protect privacy and security. Systems should integrate organizational data to maintain accuracy and designate an authoritative system of record.

#### Authentication and Trust

Authentication validates a user's identity, with different methods providing varying levels of trust. Sensitive operations may require stronger authentication, like multi-factor verification. Trust scores can guide authentication requirements, ensuring users are only challenged when necessary. This adaptive approach contrasts with traditional methods that apply uniform security measures regardless of context.

#### Use of Multiple Channels

Employing multiple communication channels enhances authentication security. For instance, one-time codes sent to separate devices or push notifications can provide additional verification layers. The security of each channel must be assessed to determine its suitability for authentication purposes.

In conclusion, managing user identities in digital systems involves distinguishing between user and device trust, securely storing identity data, and implementing adaptive authentication mechanisms. These strategies are essential for maintaining security in a zero trust environment.



### Summary

In a zero trust network, frequent validation of a clientâ€™s authorization is crucial. This ensures that changes in trust levels can be managed effectively. While authorizing every request with the control plane is ideal, it may not always be feasible. Instead, using control plane tokens rather than application tokens allows for easier revocation when trust fluctuates.

#### Authentication Methods

Authentication in zero trust networks can be achieved through four primary methods:

1. **Something You Know**: Passwords are the most common form of authentication. A strong password should be long, difficult to guess, and unique for each service. Password managers can help users maintain strong, unique passwords. Best practices include storing cryptographic hashes instead of passwords.

While encryption can be bypassed for convenience, it is essential where confidentiality is needed. Authentication remains a requirement for zero trust networks.

## Bootstrapping Trust: First Packet

The first packet in a flow can carry low trust, especially in client-facing systems. Pre-authentication, such as single-packet authorization (SPA), mitigates the first-packet problem by setting expectations for authentication.

### FireWall KNock OPerator (fwknop)

Fwknop uses SPA to authorize connections by creating temporary, tightly scoped firewall exceptions based on encrypted payloads. These exceptions are short-lived and specific to the senderâ€™s request.




### Summary

This text discusses encryption methods, network security protocols, and their implementation in zero trust networks. Two encryption modes are highlighted: **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) and **GnuPG** (Gnu Privacy Guard). AES is symmetric and preferred for personal applications due to its performance and simplicity, but it struggles with key distribution issues. GnuPG, being asymmetric, is recommended for larger scales despite its lower performance.

**HMAC** (Hash-based Message Authentication Code) is emphasized for ensuring message integrity and authenticity, preventing tampering. It is advisable to configure systems to use HMAC to protect against potential vulnerabilities in decryption routines.

The text explores where zero trust should be applied in the network stack, focusing on **TLS** (Transport Layer Security) and **IPsec** (Internet Protocol Security). TLS is common at the application layer, while IPsec operates at the internet layer and offers secure host-to-host communication by default. IPsec can be configured to enforce secure communication channels, creating a "secure virtual wire" between hosts.

Challenges with IPsec include network, device, and application support. Some networks, like AWS, do not support IPsec traffic, requiring encapsulation in UDP frames, which adds complexity. Device support is hindered by the complexity of IPsec standards, and application support requires additional configuration compared to TLS.

For network security, mutually authenticated TLS (mTLS) is recommended for client/server interactions, ensuring authenticated and authorized connections. IPsec is more suitable for server/server interactions, especially in controlled environments. Microsoft Server Isolation is highlighted for Windows environments, using IPsec configuration tied to Active Directory for fine-grained access control.

**IKE** (Internet Key Exchange) is discussed as part of the IPsec protocol suite, handling session negotiation and authentication. IKEv2 is preferred for its flexibility and reliability. The relationship between IKE and IPsec is clarified, with IKE acting as the control plane for session configuration.

For TLS, the text details the handshake process, emphasizing mutual authentication for zero trust compliance. A separation of duties is suggested, advocating for a TLS daemon to manage encryption independently from applications, enhancing control and performance consistency.

Overall, the text presents a pragmatic approach to network security, balancing the use of TLS and IPsec based on interaction types and network environments, while addressing challenges and proposing solutions for zero trust implementation.



### Summary

**Security and Performance Trade-offs in Cryptography**

Asymmetric cryptography is crucial for secure introductions and authentication but is computationally expensive. Symmetric encryption, using a single secret key, offers similar strength without the performance cost. The TLS handshake exemplifies this by generating a symmetric key for secure session traffic, combining the strengths of asymmetric cryptography without the performance drawbacks. AES is recommended for bulk encryption due to its performance, widespread implementation, and security.

Filtering is crucial in zero trust systems, implemented at various network points. Host filtering empowers endpoints to secure their traffic, contrasting with centralized systems. Software firewalls on operating systems offer flexibility, though they face risks if hosts are compromised. Isolation techniques like virtualization can enhance security by separating filtering from vulnerable hosts.

**Conclusion**

The text discusses the balance between security and performance in cryptography, the importance of message authenticity, and the challenges of securing cloud traffic. Solutions include using TLS, CASBs, and robust filtering strategies, emphasizing the zero trust model for enhanced security. Organizations must carefully manage cloud environments, ensuring compliance and security while leveraging modern technologies for optimal protection.



### Summary

In modern network security, filtering plays a crucial role in protecting systems from threats such as denial-of-service attacks. While on-host firewalls are essential, relying solely on them can be risky. To enhance security, intermediary filtering involves devices other than the sender or receiver participating in traffic filtering, which can reduce network strain and improve security.

**Bookended Filtering**: This approach applies policies both on incoming (ingress) and outgoing (egress) traffic, enhancing security by ensuring that even if one layer of defense fails, another remains active. For instance, if an administrator accidentally loosens ingress rules, egress filtering can still protect the network. Implementing bookended filtering requires detailed knowledge of expected communication flows, which can be captured programmatically to create a dependency graph for calculating egress rules.

**Project Calico**: This virtual network system exemplifies zero trust principles by distributing filtering across the network and dynamically reconfiguring hosts based on a comprehensive network database. Calico's design mirrors host filtering and includes bookended filtering, providing dual-layer enforcement for network communication.

**Intermediary Filtering**: This concept extends filtering responsibilities to network devices beyond the host, such as perimeter filters, which are crucial for managing high-throughput internet ingress traffic. These filters should combine global rules with host-specific policies to maintain network security while allowing necessary exceptions.

**Forwarding and Routing Authorization**: Zero trust networks leverage slowly changing network details to improve security. This can lead to smart network fabrics where software-defined networks (SDNs) dynamically manage routing based on authenticated and authorized flows, reducing attack surfaces and augmenting host-based defenses.

**Scenario Walkthrough**: A practical example illustrates how a zero trust network handles a user's request to access an email service over an anonymous network. The system evaluates the request using multiple criteria, including device compliance, MFA usage, and trust scores, to determine access permissions, ensuring security without hindering productivity.

**Conclusion**: Zero trust networks require authenticity and encryption in communication. They employ host, bookended, and intermediary filtering to enhance network robustness. The ultimate goal is to create a secure, adaptive network environment that balances security with operational needs. The following chapter will provide guidance on transitioning existing systems to a zero trust architecture, emphasizing the importance of understanding current network structures and choosing appropriate scopes for implementation.

### Summary of Zero Trust Network Implementation

Zero Trust Network (ZTN) is a security model emphasizing verification over blind trust. It involves several key components and strategies to enhance network security, particularly in today's threat landscape.

#### Network Flow Discovery and Categorization

Understanding network flows is crucial for ZTN. Tools like AWS Flow Logs can log every network flow, aiding in traffic analysis. However, endpoint monitoring systems are needed to tie traffic analysis back to individual applications. Software firewalls in log-only mode can help discover flows without impacting communication. Capturing and categorizing flows based on logical system connections, rather than individual IPs or ports, is essential for enforcing known connections and monitoring changes.

#### Incremental Zero Trust Adoption

Transitioning to ZTN can be done incrementally. Existing perimeter systems can be leveraged to build zero trust zones, gradually enhancing network security without disrupting current operations.

#### Micro-Segmentation

Micro-segmentation divides the network into smaller, manageable zones, allowing precise control over interactions and data flows. This approach isolates breaches, preventing them from spreading. It is especially useful in hybrid and multi-cloud environments, providing a structured security framework.

#### Software-Defined Perimeter (SDP)

SDP architecture creates isolated, on-demand networks resistant to attacks. It requires authentication and authorization before access, enhancing security by controlling connections based on user, device, and service criteria.

#### Configuration Management as a Stepping Stone

Configuration management tools are used to manage infrastructure and can serve as a temporary control plane in ZTN. They ensure consistent configuration across systems and can automate tasks like configuring cryptographic primitives. However, they should be seen as a stepping stone towards a dedicated control plane.

#### Application Authentication and Authorization

In ZTN, every service must handle authentication and authorization independently of network addresses. Integrating applications with identity providers like SAML or OAuth2 is recommended to centralize authentication. Multifactor authentication is essential to protect user credentials.

#### Load Balancers and Proxies

Load balancers distribute requests and serve as boundaries between client-facing and datacenter systems. They should handle authentication and authorization, using ephemeral credentials to represent application instances. Zero trust proxies, operating in reverse or forward modes, manage authentication and encryption responsibilities, ensuring secure connections.

#### Policy Management

Policies should be defined at the relationship level, using traditional filtering mechanisms like firewalls. Configuration management systems can help distribute and enforce policies dynamically. Policies should be captured separately from devices for auditing and adaptability.

#### Policy Distribution and Enforcement

In a ZTN, policy distribution is automated. Configuration management systems can dynamically configure devices to enforce expected communication, though this approach has limitations, such as potential policy alteration if a host is compromised.

#### Security Policy Implementation

Security policies should be stored separately from implementation systems for auditing and flexibility. A "log then enforce" approach allows for safe policy introduction and testing, minimizing unforeseen issues.

In summary, implementing a Zero Trust Network involves understanding and categorizing network flows, adopting micro-segmentation, utilizing software-defined perimeters, leveraging configuration management, and ensuring robust application authentication and authorization. These strategies collectively enhance network security and adaptability in a dynamic threat environment.



Building a zero trust network involves deploying proxies on the same device as the workload, ensuring all communication is routed through the proxy. This method offers advantages over integrating zero trust responsibilities into individual applications. External proxies on dedicated devices are not recommended as they contradict the zero trust model, which aims to secure all traffic, including between proxies and backend services.

For system administrators lacking control over all network devices, zero trust proxies can secure vendor-supplied components without modifying them. These proxies isolate components by ensuring all communication occurs through an authentication proxy, preferring direct mechanical connections.

Deciding whether to focus on client-to-server or server-to-server interactions when implementing zero trust depends on organizational needs. Client-side interactions, often involving mobile devices on uncontrolled networks, present challenges due to diverse device types and lack of automation systems. Server-side interactions, housing sensitive data, are easier to target initially due to existing automation tools and less provider diversity.

Organizations should identify priority areas, conduct threat modeling, allocate resources, implement iteratively, and continuously monitor and adapt strategies. This structured approach ensures a strategic transition to zero trust networks, focusing on the most vulnerable areas first.

Endpoint security is crucial, involving compliance with security policies, strong authentication, regular patching, and endpoint detection and response solutions. Enforcing the principle of least privilege minimizes access risks, exemplified by policies restricting admin rights on company devices.

Case studies, such as Google's BeyondCorp, illustrate successful zero trust implementations. BeyondCorp shifted from a perimeter defense model to a system where access is based on device and user credentials, regardless of network location. This approach eliminated the need for a traditional VPN, providing a consistent user experience across networks.

BeyondCorp's architecture includes a Device Inventory Database for managing devices, device certificates for unique identification, and an Access Proxy (AP) for externalizing applications. The AP enforces encryption, access control, and load balancing, integrating with Google's identity provider for user authentication.

This model demonstrates the feasibility of transitioning to zero trust, emphasizing the importance of inventory-based access control, centralized policy enforcement, and leveraging existing infrastructure like Google Front End (GFE) for policy enforcement and authentication.

### Summary of Google BeyondCorp and PagerDuty's Zero Trust Network

#### Google BeyondCorp

**Authentication and Authorization:**
Google BeyondCorp emphasizes a zero trust security model, which replaces network-based trust with device-based trust. The Access Proxy (AP) is central to this model, stripping credentials before backend requests to prevent replay attacks and allow backends to implement their own authentication.

**Centralized ACL Engine:**
BeyondCorp uses a centralized access control list (ACL) engine, queryable via remote procedure calls (RPCs), combined with a domain-specific language for ACL expression. This ensures consistent authorization across multiple gateways, like AP and RADIUS.

**Mutual Authentication:**
Mutual authentication between the proxy and backend is crucial, as the backend trusts traffic authenticated by the frontend. Google uses LOAS (Low Overhead Authentication System) for bidirectional authentication and encryption, ensuring metadata integrity and enabling incremental feature deployment.

**Device Identification:**
BeyondCorp requires consistent, non-cloneable device identifiers and an inventory database. Desktops use X.509 certificates stored securely, while mobile devices use native identifiers provided by operating systems.

**Migration Strategy:**
Googleâ€™s transition to BeyondCorp involved a phased migration to avoid business disruption. The unprivileged network resembles an external network but is within a private address space. Applications were qualified to work through the AP, and VPN usage was reduced by encouraging AP access.

**Traffic Analysis and Simulation:**
A traffic analysis pipeline captured netflow data to ensure workflows were available on the unprivileged network. A traffic monitor simulated network behavior, validating traffic against ACLs.

**Challenges and Lessons:**
Key challenges included communication balance, engineer support, data quality, and sparse data sets. Effective communication, support for engineers, and high data accuracy were critical for a successful transition.

#### PagerDuty's Zero Trust Network

**Cloud-Agnostic Approach:**
PagerDuty built a zero trust network in a multiprovider public cloud environment, focusing on server-to-server interactions. The network relies on WAN communication, with encryption and authentication to ensure data privacy and integrity.

**Configuration Management:**
PagerDuty used Chef as a configuration management tool to automate its zero trust network. Policies are centrally managed and distributed across the network, allowing scalability and isolated failures.

**Local Firewalls:**
Without consistent provider firewalls, PagerDuty dynamically calculated local firewalls using Chef to generate IPtables configurations, ensuring host security independently of provider systems.

**Conclusion:**
Both Google and PagerDuty's implementations highlight the importance of a zero trust approach in modern network security, focusing on device trust, centralized control, and adaptability to diverse environments.



### Summary

PagerDuty implemented a zero trust network to enhance security by categorizing servers based on roles, using IPtables for access control, and employing IPsec for encryption. Each server role has identical configurations, and IPtables chains manage access by enumerating IP addresses for specific roles. If network traffic doesn't match predefined rules, packets are dropped.

PagerDuty chose IPsec for distributed traffic encryption, ensuring all packets are encrypted and authenticated. This approach scales with the system, unlike application-level encryption, which can be insecure and inefficient. IPsec's transport mode is used, with strong cipher suites and UDP encapsulation to accommodate cloud provider limitations.

The implementation of an IPsec mesh network faced challenges, such as communication failures due to inconsistent states. Metrics and logging were crucial for troubleshooting. Initially configured with Chef, the system evolved to a dedicated service for faster deployment changes.

User management is decentralized, with local users and groups configured on each host, reducing network dependency. Chef data bags define users and groups, ensuring only necessary access is granted.

PagerDuty's network transitioned to a zero trust model with a careful rollout to minimize risk. Policies were gradually enabled, starting with logging and moving to enforce rules as confidence grew. This phased approach allowed for safe production traffic handling.

The zero trust model is not immune to attacks. Common attack vectors include social engineering, credential theft, privilege escalation, and DDoS attacks. Countermeasures involve multifactor authentication, security audits, and continuous monitoring. Zero trust aims to mitigate these threats by requiring authentication for both users and devices.

Building a provider-agnostic system was a significant effort for PagerDuty but proved valuable when switching cloud providers. The transition was completed in six weeks without customer impact, demonstrating the benefits of a well-planned zero trust network.

In summary, zero trust networks require careful planning and execution but offer enhanced security against modern threats. Organizations must remain vigilant against potential pitfalls and continuously adapt to evolving attack vectors.



In a cybersecurity scenario involving Bases Loaded, Inc. (BSL), an attacker gains initial access through a phishing email sent to an employee, Alex. This email masquerades as a legitimate IT department message, leading Alex to provide his credentials on a fake login page. With Alex's credentials, the attacker accesses BSL's cloud environment, discovering Alex's administrative privileges. The attacker then escalates privileges using security misconfigurations, compromising an account with elevated access linked to BSLâ€™s Azure Active Directory.

Once in control of this administrative account, the attacker moves laterally into BSLâ€™s on-premises network by exploiting a hybrid setup that synchronizes on-premises Active Directory with Azure AD. This breach allows access to sensitive data and critical infrastructure. BSL could have mitigated this risk through employee security training, implementing multifactor authentication, using cloud-only accounts for administration, and maintaining updated security configurations.

Control plane security is crucial in protecting systems that manage data routing and permissions. A compromised control plane can lead to data breaches, service disruption, unauthorized access, and regulatory non-compliance. Ensuring the security of these systems involves strict access controls, administrative isolation, and applying zero trust principles. This includes using group authentication for changes and generating alerts for modifications.

Zero trust networks facilitate perimeterless architecture, enhancing security by treating the internal network as untrusted. However, they must still address challenges like Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) and Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacks. While zero trust models ensure confidentiality, they may not fully protect against these attacks without additional measures. Organizations should employ technologies to detect suspicious activity and enforce strong authentication protocols.

Invalidation in zero trust networks involves revoking access for long-running actions that were previously authorized. This requires granular authorizations and mechanisms to reset network sessions or reauthorize actions periodically. Although challenging, these issues can be managed through strategic design choices.

Overall, the scenario underscores the importance of robust security practices, including phishing awareness, multifactor authentication, and control plane security, to protect against sophisticated attacks and ensure network integrity.



### Summary

Zero trust networks aim to enhance security by assuming that threats can come from both external and internal sources. They focus on continuous verification of user identities and device integrity, minimizing implicit trust. However, challenges remain, particularly with social engineering and physical coercion. Behavioral analysis and user training help mitigate less sensitive threats, while group authentication schemes like Shamirâ€™s Secret Sharing are reserved for critical assets.

Physical threats to zero trust networks are significant. Coercion at border crossings or via physical force can compromise systems. The strategy is to limit the sensitivity of data accessible by any single individual. Regular cycling of devices and credentials, along with scanning for unauthorized devices, are recommended practices to mitigate physical threats.

Cyber insurance provides financial protection against cyber incidents, covering regulatory penalties and third-party legal consequences. It transfers some risk to insurers, although it often excludes human-caused vulnerabilities. The insurance requires a security audit, and pricing depends on the insured entity's revenue and industry.

Zero trust networks face advanced threats that can only be detected rather than fully prevented. The model emphasizes efficient detection and damage limitation. By automating security protocols, zero trust is seen as a scalable solution to replace perimeter-based security models.

The term "zero trust" was first coined by Stephen Paul Marsh in 1994 and gained prominence in 2010 through a Forrester report. The rise of cloud computing, remote work, and AI has expanded the digital attack surface, necessitating a shift from traditional security models to zero trust. Gartner predicts that by 2026, 10% of large enterprises will have mature zero trust programs.

Various frameworks and guidelines for zero trust have been published globally by government and standardization bodies. In the U.S., Executive Order 14028 mandates zero trust implementation in federal agencies, guided by NIST and DoD standards. Key goals include enterprise-managed accounts, device tracking, encrypted network traffic, and automated security rules.

NIST's SP 800-207 outlines zero trust architecture, emphasizing continuous evaluation of trust and least privilege access. The architecture consists of core components like the Policy Engine, Policy Administrator, and Policy Enforcement Point, which work together to manage access decisions and enforce policies.

Overall, zero trust networks require a holistic approach to securing resources, including devices, services, and identities, while continuously monitoring and dynamically adjusting access policies.
