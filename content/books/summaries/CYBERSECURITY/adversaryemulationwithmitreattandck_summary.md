### Summary

Established in 1996, the focus on export controls for conventional arms and dual-use technologies sets the backdrop for understanding cyber threats. Two primary types of attackers are identified: stereotypical hackers motivated by financial gain, and advanced persistent threats (APTs) aiming to steal intellectual property and state secrets. Traditional hackers often use tools developed by APTs, making detection challenging. To build effective defenses, it is crucial to observe adversary behavior rather than only focusing on indicators of compromise (IoCs).

**Maximizing Adversary Cost:**

David Bianco’s Pyramid of Pain illustrates the effectiveness of defense strategies based on adversary behavior. The pyramid categorizes IoCs by the difficulty they pose to attackers:

1. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):** The most challenging for adversaries to change, targeting TTPs forces attackers to learn new behaviors, increasing their operational costs.
   
2. **Tools:** Blocking specific tools can compel adversaries to seek alternatives, increasing their effort and cost.
   
3. **Network/Host Artifacts:** Identifying and filtering network interactions can disrupt adversary operations.
   
4. **Domain Names:** Harder to acquire than IP addresses, domain names can be blocked to hinder adversaries.
   
5. **IP Addresses:** Easily changed by attackers, making them less effective to block.
   
6. **Hash Values:** Simple for adversaries to alter, but context-triggered piecewise hashes (CTPH) can detect moderate changes.

**Adversary-Inspired Testing:**

Incorporating cyber threat intelligence (CTI) and mimicking adversary behavior helps test defense coverage effectively. This approach aids in understanding adversary attack life cycles, prioritizing technologies, and identifying successful defense integrations.

**Drawbacks of Traditional Security Assessments:**

Traditional assessments like penetration testing often create a toxic relationship between IT departments and security service providers. Common issues include time-boxed assessments, unrealistic defenses set up after assessment announcements, and a focus on initial access objectives, neglecting insider threats. A more mature security discipline is needed for holistic defense assessments.

**Types of Security Assessments:**

- **Vulnerability Scanning:** Identifies and prioritizes software vulnerabilities. Tools like Nessus, Nexpose, and Qualys are used for scanning.
  
- **Vulnerability Assessment:** A systematic examination to identify security deficiencies and recommend remediation.
  
- **Penetration Testing:** Simulates cyberattacks to inspect vulnerabilities. It involves focus, paradigm, and methodology to define the scope.

- **Red Teaming:** A stealthy procedure that tests people, processes, and technology by simulating adversary actions. It aims to uncover weaknesses by thinking like attackers.

Red teaming and penetration testing differ in scope and methodology, with red teams focusing on stealth and comprehensive evaluations of security postures.

By understanding these strategies and assessments, organizations can better prepare and defend against evolving cyber threats.

## Summary

Adversary Emulation (AE) is a cybersecurity discipline focusing on mimicking adversary behavior to assess the resilience of people, processes, and technology. AE involves creating detailed Adversary Emulation Plans (AEPs) that compile adversary tactics and techniques, allowing cybersecurity practitioners to model Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. These plans include resources like tools, binaries, and scripts to support execution and engagement goals. Collaboration with the blue team is crucial to map detection and mitigation techniques, ensuring security controls are effectively tuned.

The emulation process is executed in phases: planning, executing, and reporting. During execution, tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) are run in the environment, and results are collected to prepare reports focusing on the behavior of both attackers and defenders. Tools like ATT&CK Navigator help visualize defense coverage, providing a holistic security view. Unexpected events during emulation require predefined strategies to maintain focus and address issues.

AE practitioners must communicate clearly to avoid confusion, often using frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK to standardize terminology. Effective communication enables better collaboration and helps identify security gaps and vulnerabilities.

APT groups are sophisticated threat actors with advanced knowledge of technology and systems. They maintain persistence by establishing backdoors and employing stealthy approaches, often targeting supply chains. These groups are well-funded and can execute operations with significant impact, such as stealing sensitive data or disrupting critical systems.

APTs employ advanced strategies, including social engineering and exploiting protocol weaknesses, to gain unauthorized access. Once inside, they aim to remain undetected, maximizing the damage or data theft. The time between intrusion and threat eradication, known as dwell time, is critical. Metrics like Mean Time to Detect (MTTD) and Mean Time to Repair (MTTR) measure an organization's ability to detect and respond to threats. Lower values indicate more effective security measures.

The concept of APTs originated in the US military to describe state-sponsored espionage, later adopted by the civilian tech community. These threats have evolved, with sectors like government, finance, and telecommunications frequently targeted. The pursuit of cyber hegemony by states has fueled the activities of these groups, making them challenging to defend against.

In conclusion, AE is a mature process that tests network resilience and generates intelligence to enhance security. Understanding and emulating adversary behavior is crucial for developing effective defenses against ever-evolving threats.
