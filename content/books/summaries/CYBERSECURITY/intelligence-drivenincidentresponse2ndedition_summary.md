### Summary

The evolving landscape of cybersecurity necessitates a shift towards intelligence-driven incident response, which integrates threat intelligence into security operations. This approach requires analysts to not only detect threats at the perimeter but also delve deeper into networks, examining user systems, servers, and third-party services to identify and understand attackers.

#### Intelligence-Driven Incident Response

Intelligence is defined as refined data that aids stakeholders in decision-making. In incident response, intelligence is gathered, analyzed, and used to support actions against cyber threats. This process is continuous, feeding back into the intelligence cycle and informing future security measures.

Key components of intelligence-driven incident response include:
- **Direction**: Setting goals for intelligence gathering.
- **Collection**: Gathering relevant data.
- **Processing and Analysis**: Refining data into actionable intelligence.
- **Dissemination and Feedback**: Sharing findings to improve ongoing operations.

This approach helps identify weaknesses in network defenses and understand attackers' tactics, motivations, and goals. It also supports broader applications such as network defense and user awareness training.

#### Case Studies

**Operation SMN**: This operation highlighted the effectiveness of intelligence-driven response. The Axiom Group, a sophisticated threat actor, was identified through coordinated efforts that revealed complex malware behavior and strategic targeting. The intelligence cycle was effectively employed, leading to the eradication of 43,000 malware installations.

#### Conclusion

Intelligence-driven incident response is crucial for adapting to the ever-changing threat environment. By understanding attackers' motivations and methods, defenders can better prevent, detect, and respond to threats. This structured approach is essential for developing effective security strategies tailored to an organization's needs.

#### Intelligence Basics

Intelligence analysis involves gathering and analyzing data to provide actionable insights. Unlike typical research, intelligence work deals with adversaries who actively conceal their activities. Key differences include:
- **Secrecy**: Information may be intentionally hidden.
- **Timeliness**: Analysis must be prompt to remain relevant.
- **Reproducibility**: Findings are often unique and not easily replicated.

Understanding the distinction between data and intelligence is crucial. Data is raw information, while intelligence is processed data that provides context and supports decision-making.

By integrating intelligence into incident response, organizations can enhance their security posture and better anticipate and counter threats.



In information security, data such as IP addresses or domains are mere facts without analysis. When analyzed, they become intelligence, which is crucial for decision-making. Intelligence must reach its intended audience promptly to be effective. Intelligence analysis combines journalism's dynamics with scientific problem-solving, transforming data into actionable insights.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) were once equated with threat intelligence but are just one aspect. They help detect threats and are valuable for post-incident analysis. Intelligence is derived from various sources, known as INTs, including:

- **HUMINT**: Human-source intelligence from interactions or covert methods.
- **SIGINT**: Signals intelligence from intercepted communications.
- **OSINT**: Open source intelligence from public sources.
- **IMINT**: Imagery intelligence from visual data.
- **MASINT**: Measurement and signature intelligence from technical means.
- **GEOINT**: Geospatial intelligence from location-based data.

Cyber threat intelligence often involves specific methods like incident investigations, honeypots, and monitoring forums. These methods provide rich data for analysis.

Military terminology influences intelligence, but its usefulness varies. Analysts use models to manage the vast data and generate insights. Models, like the Diamond Model of Intrusion Analysis, help structure information for analysis. They enable collaboration by making mental processes explicit.

The OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) is a decision-making model used in security. It involves collecting information, contextualizing it, deciding on actions, and executing them. This cycle helps defenders respond to threats effectively.

Overall, intelligence is about transforming data into actionable insights through structured analysis, using diverse sources and models to guide decision-making and collaboration.



In cybersecurity, the OODA loop (Observe, Orient, Decide, Act) is crucial for both attackers and defenders. The side that adapts faster often prevails. However, predicting adversarial responses is complex due to human unpredictability. To mitigate this, defenders should align their actions with their core mission, whether it's safeguarding data or public safety.

Beyond attacker-defender dynamics, defender-defender interactions are important. Actions like sharing incident response information can create race conditions among defenders. If attackers adapt quickly to shared intelligence, they can outmaneuver other defenders. Thus, defenders must consider the broader impact of their actions and aim to slow adversaries’ OODA loops while accelerating their own.

The intelligence cycle is a structured process for generating and evaluating intelligence, consisting of six steps: direction, collection, processing, analysis, dissemination, and feedback. 

1. **Direction**: Establish clear questions that intelligence should answer, often derived from stakeholder requirements.

2. **Collection**: Gather data from diverse sources, ensuring redundancy for corroboration. Building a broad collection capability is crucial as the relevance of data may not be immediately apparent.

3. **Processing**: Convert collected data into usable formats. This includes normalizing data, indexing for searchability, translating, enriching with metadata, filtering irrelevant information, and prioritizing critical data.

4. **Analysis**: Interpret data using analytic models to identify connections and make assessments. Analysis must address the initial questions, acknowledging any information gaps that may require additional data collection.

5. **Dissemination**: Share intelligence with stakeholders in a usable format. Tailor the presentation to the audience, whether executives or technical teams.

6. **Feedback**: Evaluate whether the intelligence met its objectives. Success may lead to further inquiries, while failure requires reassessment of the process.

Effective intelligence hinges on the quality of data sources and analysis. Understanding the collection method and the date of data acquisition is essential, as most cyber threat data is perishable. Analysts must be aware of biases in their analysis to ensure the generation of high-quality intelligence.

The intelligence cycle is a versatile model applicable to various scenarios, from understanding new threat groups to answering specific stakeholder questions. However, following the steps does not guarantee good intelligence; the quality of sources and analysis is paramount.



Understanding the context and timing of data collection is crucial for effective analysis and action. Analysts must be aware of biases like confirmation and anchoring biases, which can skew analysis. Intelligence is categorized into tactical, operational, and strategic levels, each serving different purposes and audiences.

**Tactical Intelligence** involves low-level, specific information that aids security operations and incident response, such as Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). It helps in immediate threat mitigation, like identifying malicious IPs or domains.

**Operational Intelligence** supports broader logistical operations and includes information on campaigns, actor attribution, and higher-order TTPs. It requires timely action and involves complexities in decision-making, balancing urgency with potential long-term impacts.

**Strategic Intelligence** aids in high-level decision-making by providing insights into threat trends and actor motivations. It supports executives in risk assessments and strategic planning, often requiring a holistic view of threats.

**Confidence Levels** in intelligence reflect the trust in the accuracy of information, often assessed through systems like the Admiralty Code, which evaluates source reliability and information content. Sherman Kent’s work on estimative probability provides qualitative ways to express confidence in analysis.

The field of intelligence is built on structured processes to counter biases and ensure rigorous analysis. It is integral to incident response, which involves detecting and responding to intrusions. Models like the OODA loop help in understanding and planning responses.

The **Incident-Response Cycle** includes Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned. Preparation involves hardening systems, deploying detection capabilities, and practicing response plans. Identification is the phase where adversary activity is detected, leading to investigation. Containment involves immediate actions to limit adversary impact, such as disabling network access or blocking malicious infrastructure.

Preparation is crucial, allowing defenders to leverage their understanding of the environment to counter the adversary's advantage of surprise. Effective preparation includes mapping the attack surface, ensuring visibility, hardening systems, establishing processes, and practicing response strategies.

In summary, intelligence and incident response are interconnected fields that require understanding biases, confidence levels, and structured processes to effectively manage and mitigate threats.



Incident response involves several key phases: Containment, Eradication, Recovery, and Lessons Learned. Each phase plays a critical role in managing and mitigating security incidents effectively.

### Containment
Containment is most effective against less-sophisticated threats like commodity malware. However, it can alert sophisticated adversaries, prompting them to establish new tools or backdoors. For such adversaries, moving directly to Eradication may be preferable.

### Eradication
Eradication involves long-term actions to remove adversaries and prevent re-entry. This includes removing malware, resetting credentials, and hardening the network. A scorched-earth approach may be used, applying remediations even on resources without clear compromise signs. This can be labor-intensive, requiring collaboration with risk management and system owners.

### Wiping and Reloading
Debate exists between wiping systems versus malware removal. While antivirus claims to remove malware, experienced responders often prefer a full system wipe and reload. This approach is facilitated by cloud tools like Ansible and Kubernetes, though it requires ensuring no compromised dependencies are redeployed.

### Recovery
Recovery restores systems to a non-incident state, reversing actions taken during containment and eradication. It involves coordination between security and IT teams. Effective collaboration is crucial, as premature recovery actions can compromise the response.

### Lessons Learned
The final phase involves evaluating the response to improve future efforts. This includes assessing what happened, what went well, and what could improve. Despite resistance due to fear of blame or time constraints, this phase is essential for advancing incident-response capabilities.

### The Kill Chain
The kill chain is a model describing adversary actions during an intrusion, focusing on steps like Targeting and Reconnaissance. It helps defenders understand and disrupt adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs). Targeting involves deciding what to attack, revealing adversary motivations. Reconnaissance gathers information about the target, using active or passive methods, and can involve both hard (technical) and soft (organizational) data.

### Reconnaissance
Reconnaissance collects data about the target, categorized into hard data (technical) and soft data (organizational). Collection methods can be active, requiring direct interaction, or passive, using third-party information. Detecting reconnaissance varies; active methods are easier to spot than passive ones.

### Conclusion
The incident-response cycle is crucial for managing security incidents, emphasizing the importance of each phase, from preparation to lessons learned. Understanding models like the kill chain aids in conceptualizing adversary actions and improving defensive strategies.




## Summary

### GreyNoise and Reconnaissance

GreyNoise is useful for identifying systems scanning and attempting to exploit vulnerabilities, such as during the Log4J exploitation in late 2021. It helps in blocking malicious IPs and identifying adversary strings early on, but its efficacy diminishes as more parties begin scanning, increasing noise.

### Weaponization

Weaponization involves finding vulnerabilities and crafting exploits to deliver to targets. Adversaries seek mismatches between software intention and implementation to exploit. They must decide between targeting widely used software with known defenses or more obscure software with fewer defenses but limited deployment. This decision is influenced by their intelligence requirements.

### Vulnerability Hunting

Vulnerability hunting impacts target selection. Widely used software like Microsoft Windows is heavily defended, while niche software may be less secure but less prevalent. Adversaries weigh these factors, as seen in the Stuxnet incident targeting Siemens PLCs. Defenders counter this by using security development practices and strong patch management to reduce vulnerabilities.

### Exploitability

Exploitation involves triggering vulnerabilities to gain control. This requires crafting reliable exploits, which can be challenging due to language packs and defenses like ASLR. Successful exploitation provides adversaries a method to access targets.

### Implant Development

Implants maintain access without repeated exploitation. They are developed with stealth and functionality, enabling adversaries to achieve goals like data exfiltration. Implants can be beaconing or non-beaconing, determined by network topology and device type. Some attacks, like the compromise of John Podesta's email, succeed without implants, making investigation harder.

### Testing

Testing ensures exploits and implants function as intended and remain undetectable by security tools. Detectability testing is crucial, as security systems look for behaviors indicating malicious activity.

### Infrastructure Development

Infrastructure supports malicious code deployment. Adversaries use command-and-control servers, exfiltration points, and hot points. They require certificates for code signing and TLS to avoid security warnings. Adversaries use servers, domains, and email addresses for delivery and communication.

### Nontechnical Infrastructure Needs

Adversaries need identities and currency to set up infrastructure. They use pseudonyms, fake identities, and semi-anonymous payment systems like cryptocurrency. Some use compromised systems for infrastructure, while others leverage free online services.

### Delivery

Delivery involves sending weaponized exploits to targets, often via spear phishing or exploiting web services. This stage is the first active interaction with the target, providing potential indicators of compromise.

### Exploitation

Exploitation occurs when adversaries gain control of code execution, marking the start of their move into the network. This involves executing their code, establishing a foothold, and beginning the adversary's network infiltration.

### Installation

Once code execution is achieved, adversaries seek to maintain persistence by installing backdoors or remote-access Trojans, ensuring continued access to compromised systems.




Adversaries typically begin by establishing persistence on a compromised system using rootkits or remote-access Trojans (RATs), which allow them to evade detection and maintain access. They often aim to extend their reach across multiple systems, using captured credentials or native tools like PsExec or SSH. This network persistence involves accessing broadly used network resources such as VPNs or cloud services, reducing the need for malware and lowering detection risks.

Once persistence is achieved, adversaries require command and control (C2) channels to send instructions. Historically, this involved IRC channels or HTTP calls, but modern methods include DNS lookups and social media. Some malware operates autonomously, like Stuxnet, which was designed for air-gapped networks, requiring defenders to focus on identifying and eradicating malware directly on systems.

The ultimate goal of these intrusions, known as Actions on Objective (AoO), often involves data exfiltration, as data is highly valuable. Adversaries may also pivot within networks, moving from less critical systems to high-value targets. Other AoO include destruction, denial, degradation, disruption, and deception, each affecting the target's infrastructure or information integrity.

The incident-response cycle begins with identifying these attacks, ideally during the Delivery phase to prevent execution. If detected later, during C2 or AoO phases, the response becomes complex and resource-intensive.

The Kill Chain model outlines the stages of an attack, from targeting and reconnaissance to weaponization and delivery. For example, a fictitious group, Grey Spike, might target election campaigns by sending weaponized documents that exploit vulnerabilities, leading to RAT installation and network access expansion.

The Diamond Model complements the Kill Chain by categorizing attacks into events involving an adversary, capability, infrastructure, and victim. This model helps visualize the interactions and motivations of attacks, aiding in strategic planning and response.

MITRE's ATT&CK framework further enhances these models by providing a knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques, helping analysts develop threat models and methodologies. It categorizes adversary actions into tactics (the "why") and techniques (the "how"), offering a structured approach to understanding and mitigating cyber threats.



## Summary

### Intrusion Activity and ATT&CK Framework

Intrusion activity is tracked by analysts using terms like threat groups, activity groups, and campaigns. The MITRE ATT&CK framework is a widely used model for understanding adversary tactics and techniques observed during network operations. ATT&CK provides a matrix form of tactics and techniques, serving as a resource for incident responders and intelligence teams. It extends beyond government use and is employed by vendors, security teams, and researchers.

### Security Teams: Red, Blue, Purple, and Black

- **Blue Team:** Focuses on defense, including intrusion detection and incident response.
- **Red Team:** Conducts offensive security tests to improve defenses.
- **Purple Team:** Integrates blue and red teams to enhance collaboration and feedback.
- **Black Team:** Represents actual attackers, though the term is less common.

### D3FEND Framework

D3FEND, created with NSA funding, complements ATT&CK by detailing defensive countermeasures. It links defensive techniques to offensive techniques, potentially guiding system hardening and detection strategies.

### Active Defense

Active defense aims to disrupt adversaries without engaging in illegal activities like hacking back. It includes:

- **Deny:** Blocking adversary access preemptively.
- **Disrupt:** Actively interfering with adversary operations.
- **Degrade:** Reducing adversary resources during use.
- **Deceive:** Misleading adversaries with false information.
- **Destroy:** Reserved for authorized entities like law enforcement.

### F3EAD Framework

F3EAD combines intelligence and operations cycles to enhance incident response and intelligence generation:

- **Find:** Identifying threats using various intelligence sources.
- **Fix:** Locating adversaries in the network.
- **Finish:** Conducting incident response actions.
- **Exploit:** Gathering intelligence from adversary actions.
- **Analyze:** Assessing implications and deriving actionable insights.
- **Disseminate:** Sharing intelligence with decision-makers effectively.

### Conclusion

Frameworks like ATT&CK, D3FEND, and F3EAD provide structured approaches to cybersecurity, integrating offensive and defensive strategies with intelligence cycles. Active defense and collaboration between security teams enhance the ability to anticipate and respond to threats effectively.



Understanding the audience is crucial for effective intelligence dissemination. Audiences typically include tactical teams, strategic management, and third-party groups. Tactical teams focus on Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) and Techniques, Tactics, and Procedures (TTPs), while strategic management is interested in generalized TTPs for future planning. Third-party groups require a tailored approach based on collaboration goals.

The F3EAD (Find, Fix, Finish, Exploit, Analyze, Disseminate) cycle is essential for integrating threat intelligence and incident response. This model creates a loop where security operations inform intelligence and vice versa, enhancing both processes. The cycle can be applied beyond security operations to areas like vulnerability management.

Choosing the right model for incident response depends on factors like time, data type, and analyst preference. Models such as the Diamond Model or OODA loop are useful depending on the situation.

The book explores intelligence-driven incident response using the F3EAD model, focusing on a scenario named "Road Runner," involving a fictitious attack group, Grey Spike. The process involves identifying adversaries, investigating their activities, removing them, and exploiting data to gain insights. This intelligence is then disseminated in useful formats.

The Find phase is crucial for identifying adversaries. Various targeting methods include actor-centric, victim-centric, and infrastructure-centric approaches. Actor-centric targeting involves unraveling an attacker's tactics and techniques, often requiring persistence and luck. Understanding an actor's motivations and methods helps build a target package for further operations.

David J. Bianco's Pyramid of Pain illustrates the difficulty of changing various types of threat information. The goal is to gather information higher up the pyramid, which is harder for adversaries to alter, thus providing more valuable intelligence.

Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are basic yet essential data points in threat analysis. While they provide a starting point, more strategic intelligence is needed for comprehensive threat mitigation.

In conclusion, models provide structure to incident response processes. Familiarity with these models aids in selecting the appropriate approach for different incidents, ultimately enhancing threat intelligence and response capabilities.



In cybersecurity, Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) are crucial for identifying known threats and attacker methodologies. IOCs include filesystem indicators like file hashes, memory indicators such as strings, and network indicators like IP addresses. These indicators help in monitoring and responding to threats. More complex to alter are attacker behaviors, captured as Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs) at the top of the Pyramid of Pain. Understanding behaviors is essential for mapping an attacker’s methods within the kill chain, which includes phases like reconnaissance, weaponization, and exploitation.

Actor-centric targeting begins with the kill chain, allowing analysts to use known information about an attack to predict and investigate other phases. For instance, if an attack uses macros in Word documents, analysts can look for related privilege escalation artifacts. Building a kill chain, even with gaps, provides a structured approach to understanding and anticipating attacker actions.

The text also discusses a case study involving a campaign named "Road Runner," where phishing emails targeted election campaign staff. These emails contained weaponized PDFs exploiting a known vulnerability (CVE-2018-4916). The kill chain for Road Runner was developed using both external reports and internal findings, highlighting the importance of documenting and filling in knowledge gaps during incident response.

Goals of attackers are inferred from their actions and remain consistent even if their methods change. Understanding these goals is crucial for tracking adversaries. Sometimes attackers may "moonlight," shifting their goals but using the same TTPs, which can indicate new strategic interests.

Victim-centric targeting focuses on understanding the impact on victims, which can provide insights into the adversary’s objectives. This approach uses the Diamond Model to capture relationships between victims and adversaries, infrastructure, and capabilities. Key questions include why certain victims were targeted and what commonalities they share. This method helps identify additional malicious activities and potential future targets.

In summary, effective cybersecurity involves understanding both the technical indicators of attacks and the broader behaviors and goals of adversaries. Using structured models like the kill chain and Diamond Model aids in organizing information and developing strategies to counter threats. The Road Runner case study exemplifies the application of these concepts in real-world incident response. 



## Summary

**Asset-Centric Targeting**  
Asset-centric targeting focuses on protecting specific technologies, even without confirmed adversary activity. It is particularly useful for systems like industrial control systems (ICS), which require domain knowledge to attack. This method helps limit attackers based on their ability to understand and exploit specific systems. The approach involves identifying the types of systems being protected and understanding who is capable of attacking them. Third-party research can aid both attackers and defenders by providing insights into potential vulnerabilities.

**Using Asset-Centric Targeting**  
Organizations developing unique technologies, such as ICS or IoT devices, benefit most from asset-centric targeting. It requires a customized approach similar to a kill chain. In the Road Runner scenario, phishing emails targeting PDF reader vulnerabilities were identified, but specifics on system targeting remain unclear. The focus is on gathering more information to address gaps in understanding adversary activity.

**Capability-Centric Targeting**  
This approach involves identifying adversaries based on their tools and methods. It emphasizes using the least sophisticated tools necessary for achieving goals, thus preventing overlooking simple methods. Analysts can use tools like VirusTotal to identify additional information from malware hashes or filenames. Capability-centric targeting helps in clustering similar items for deeper insights. It's crucial to avoid excessive pivoting and focus on relevant information.

**Using Malware to Identify Threat Actors**  
Attributing attacks based on malware alone is outdated due to widespread sharing and repurposing of tools. Instead, a combination of goals, motivations, and behaviors should be considered. Identifying previously used malware can still provide useful information during investigations.

**Media-Centric Targeting**  
Media-centric targeting often arises from executive requests based on news reports. It involves analyzing current events to determine their relevance to an organization. The goal is to distill broad queries into focused investigations, potentially identifying risks like intellectual property theft from state-sponsored actors.

**Targeting Based on Third-Party Notification**  
Third-party notifications of breaches provide initial targeting information, such as indicators or actor details. Establishing confidentiality and operational security is crucial for effective information sharing. Organizations benefit from participating in information-sharing groups, balancing receiving and contributing intelligence.

**Prioritizing Targeting**  
Prioritization in the Find phase is essential. Immediate needs, such as stakeholder requests, take precedence. Past incidents offer valuable insights for detecting future attacks, especially from opportunistic or persistent attackers. Criticality varies by organization, prioritizing issues with higher operational impact.

**Organizing Targeting Activities**  
Organizing and vetting information from the Find phase involves categorizing data into manageable formats. This preparation ensures readiness for subsequent phases of threat intelligence processes.



In the incident response process, distinguishing between hard and soft leads is crucial. Hard leads are directly related to known incidents, whereas soft leads may indicate potential threats but require further investigation. During the Find phase, identifying and categorizing these leads helps streamline subsequent actions. Proper documentation and storage of leads, using tools like spreadsheets or threat-intelligence platforms, are vital for efficient workflow and team visibility.

The Request for Information (RFI) process is also important, providing a structured way for external stakeholders to request intelligence. This process should include details like the request, requestor, expected output, references, and priority. Implementing a formal RFI system can help manage high volumes of informal requests.

The Find phase is the first step in the F3EAD intelligence cycle, setting the stage for subsequent phases like Fix. It involves identifying threats and organizing information to prepare for targeted actions. Proper documentation and prioritization during this phase are essential for a smooth transition to the Fix phase.

In the Fix phase, intelligence gathered is used to detect adversary activities through indicators of compromise and behavioral patterns. This phase supports intrusion detection by integrating intelligence into network and system alerting. Network alerting identifies malicious traffic, while system alerting detects attacker presence on endpoints. External reflections, such as data on dark web marketplaces, can also provide insights into intrusions.

Network alerting involves monitoring traffic for signs of attacker communications. However, alerting on reconnaissance often results in high noise due to constant scanning activities. Instead, focusing on the Delivery phase, where attackers deliver payloads via email or websites, is more effective. Alerting on email attachments, links, and metadata can help detect phishing attempts and other malicious activities.

Credential reuse remains a significant threat, as attackers exploit weak or reused passwords to gain access. Monitoring for unusual login patterns, such as logins from unexpected locations or concurrent logins, can help detect unauthorized access. Training users to report suspicious activities can also aid in early detection.

In summary, the Find and Fix phases involve identifying and categorizing leads, documenting intelligence, and using it to detect and respond to threats. Proper organization and integration of intelligence into detection systems are key to effective incident response.



In the realm of cybersecurity, detecting suspicious logins and activities is crucial. When an attacker infiltrates a network, logs can be used for identifying suspicious activities, leading to password resets and the implementation of two-factor authentication (2FA). Command and control (C2) is a critical phase where attackers communicate with malware, resulting in network communication. Detecting C2 involves analyzing destination addresses, content, frequency, and duration of communications. Known malicious IPs and domains can be blacklisted, and unexpected geographic destinations flagged. Malware often uses encrypted messages, sometimes mismatched with protocols, to evade detection. Regular communication intervals, or beacons, help identify patterns, aiding in detection. 

C2 trends have evolved, with attackers using shared resources like social media for communication, complicating detection. Tools must understand organizational services to identify unknown resources. Some malware operates without C2, especially in secure environments, requiring focus on delivery and impact for detection.

Data exfiltration, often the goal of attacks, involves moving large data volumes from victim systems to attacker-controlled systems. Detection strategies include data-loss prevention tools and analyzing metadata around network connections. Monitoring network activity helps understand attacker behavior.

System monitoring complements network alerting, focusing on specific phases of the kill chain, such as initial access, execution, persistence, and privilege escalation. Tools must integrate with operating systems for effective alerting. Exploitation alerting focuses on tracking new or modified processes, indicating intrusion. Installation alerting involves detecting actions that maintain access, such as installing remote-access Trojans (RATs).

Impact alerting involves monitoring actions like creating, reading, updating, and deleting files. Ransomware, for example, reads, encrypts, and deletes files. Understanding attacker goals, such as intellectual property theft, helps tailor detection strategies.

The Road Runner campaign by Grey Spike involves spear-phishing, web compromises, and tools like Hikit and Derusbi. Detecting Road Runner involves monitoring network activity for spear-phishing emails and compromised websites, and system activity for exploitation of known vulnerabilities like CVE-2013-3893.

Overall, effective intrusion detection requires understanding attacker tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs), and leveraging tools and intelligence to identify and respond to threats.



The text discusses various aspects of intrusion detection and investigation, focusing on techniques and tools used in network security. It begins by highlighting the importance of understanding vulnerabilities and the tools commonly used by attackers, such as Road Runner, to enhance network defense strategies.

   - **Full Content Analysis:** Captures every bit of network traffic, allowing for comprehensive analysis and reanalysis of stored data. It provides the ability to recreate user activities and apply new intelligence to past data.

**Traffic Analysis:**

Traffic analysis is a foundational technique that uses metadata, such as endpoints, ports, and connection durations, to discern malicious activities. It is cost-effective and allows for long-term data storage and analysis. Tools like NetFlow, Bro, SiLK, and Argus facilitate traffic analysis by capturing network flow data. The text highlights the importance of applying intelligence to traffic analysis to identify patterns of anomalous activity and generate leads for further investigation.

**Signature-Based Analysis:**

Signature-based analysis relies on IDS to monitor network traffic for specific patterns. Snort signatures are a common standard, allowing for alert generation based on predefined rules. The effectiveness of this analysis depends on the accurate creation, modification, and removal of signatures. Analysts must have access to both known good and bad traffic to test and refine signatures.

**Full Content Analysis:**

Full content analysis provides the most detailed view of network traffic, enabling the reanalysis of data with new intelligence. Despite its storage challenges, it allows for the reconstruction of user activities and the application of new tools and configurations. This technique is particularly valuable for developing signatures, extracting files, and identifying protocol anomalies.

**Application of Intelligence:**

Intelligence can be applied across all analysis techniques, enhancing the detection and understanding of malicious activities. Full content analysis, in particular, offers flexibility in applying intelligence, allowing for detailed packet-level analysis and the reapplication of intelligence to historical data.

Overall, the text underscores the importance of using a combination of traffic, signature-based, and full content analysis to effectively detect and investigate network intrusions. Each technique offers unique advantages and challenges, and their integration is crucial for comprehensive network security management.



### Summary

In the realm of cybersecurity, several advanced techniques and tools are crucial for detecting, analyzing, and responding to threats. Here’s a comprehensive overview of these methods:

#### Live Response
Live response involves analyzing potentially compromised systems without taking them offline, preserving system state information like active processes. This method collects configuration information, system state, and persistence mechanisms. Initially, tools like OSXCollector and FastIR were used, but many have been deprecated as they were manual and time-consuming. Today, automation and integration with intelligence sources enhance live response efficiency.

#### Memory Analysis
Memory analysis focuses on volatile system states, providing insights into processes and potential stealthy threats. Tools like Mandiant’s Redline and the Volatility framework are prominent. Redline collects system memory and uses OpenIOC for analysis, while Volatility, a Python-based framework, reads memory formats from various tools. Integrating intelligence, such as Yara signatures, is tool-dependent and enhances detection capabilities.

#### Disk Analysis
Disk forensics involves extracting filesystem information from hard drives. Tools like EnCase and FTK perform file carving, making system data accessible for analysis.

Scoping during an incident helps determine affected resources, influencing response strategies. Identifying patterns among affected systems can provide deeper attack insights. Effective scoping relies on inventory management and collaboration with IT teams, using IOCs and behavior patterns.

Hunting is proactive, searching for IOCs without alerts, requiring planning, process, and good intelligence. It's about developing hypotheses from past incidents, organizational profiles, and vulnerability assessments. Testing hypotheses helps avoid false positives, refining leads for effective detection.

Integrating intelligence into alerting, investigation, and hunting enhances processes and training. Alerting identifies essential information, while investigation gathers context for understanding incidents. Mastering these allows for proactive hunting of undetected malicious activity, aiming to understand the incident scope and plan a response.

The Finish phase involves removing threats and understanding how they accessed the network. It focuses on eradicating footholds, communication channels, and redundant access. Unlike hacking back, which is illegal and risky, Finish focuses on resources you control. It involves mitigation, remediation, and rearchitecting, with mitigation being the first step to prevent further intrusion.

Mitigation involves temporary steps to prevent intrusion escalation, coordinated to avoid tipping off adversaries. It includes blocking delivery methods and command and control channels. Proper planning and execution ensure adversaries can't maintain access, allowing for successful remediation and network control.

Overall, the process of reverse engineering, malware analysis, and incident response is about understanding threats, applying intelligence, and executing strategic actions to secure networks and systems effectively.



### Summary

In cybersecurity, attackers often set up alternative access points, such as installing secondary Remote Access Trojans (RATs) with longer communication intervals to avoid detection. Even if primary tools are removed, attackers can regain access. To counter this, revoking sessions when changing passwords is crucial, as compromised sessions can allow adversaries to maintain control. Application-specific passwords, often overlooked, should also be addressed as they can provide long-term access.

**Mitigation Strategies:**

- **Immediate Mitigation:** Stakeholders often demand quick action to limit adversary access to sensitive information or critical systems. This involves reducing network transport options, stopping malware, and possibly shutting down affected resources. Network access controls and limiting outbound connections are essential, but on-system responses may also be necessary.

- **Road Runner Campaign:** This campaign accessed networks via spear-phishing emails. To prevent reestablishment, emails are rerouted to a sandbox for analysis. Raising staff awareness is crucial, as opening emails from unknown senders is a daily task. Command-and-control activities are blocked at firewalls and system levels, and password resets across the environment are enforced to revoke compromised credentials.

**Remediation Process:**

- **Exploitation Remediation:** This typically involves patching vulnerabilities. If a patch is unavailable, isolating systems or enforcing strict access controls is necessary. Custom code requires collaboration with internal teams for security issues.

- **Social Engineering:** Training users to recognize attacks is vital, as technical solutions alone are insufficient.

**Summary**

Effective adversary activity management requires comprehensive strategic, operational, and tactical planning. A well-coordinated plan ensures timely actions, preventing chaos and missed opportunities to address adversary infrastructure. Missing compromised elements like machines or credentials can create a false sense of security.

**Key Defensive Actions:**

1. **Deny**: This initial response aims to remove attackers' access by changing credentials, removing backdoors, and preventing lateral movement within the network. Identifying access methods during the Find phase is crucial for complete denial.

2. **Disrupt**: When denying access isn't feasible, disruption forces attackers to take ineffective actions, restricting their operations and access to targeted information. This involves additional access controls and alerting systems.

3. **Degrade**: Unlike binary deny/disrupt actions, degradation reduces the effectiveness of adversary actions by slowing down their operations, such as throttling bandwidth for command-and-control communications.

4. **Deceive**: Deception involves misleading attackers with false information or honeypots to divert their efforts. This requires careful balancing to avoid detection and is best suited for advanced operations.

5. **Destroy**: Physical destruction of compromised systems is rarely advisable since actions occur within your network. Removing outdated systems is a more appropriate response.

**Incident Data Organization:**

Recording incident details is critical, focusing on initial leads, attacker tactics, compromised hosts, and response actions. A single source of truth ensures coordinated efforts among responders. Tools for tracking actions range from personal notes to spreadsheets and purpose-built systems.

- **Personal Notes**: Analysts often start with personal notes, which are valuable for individual investigations but less useful for team-wide exploitation.
  
- **Spreadsheet of Doom (SOD)**: Teams often use spreadsheets to track indicators of compromise, compromised resources, and response actions. Consistency in format is crucial for effective use.

- **Third-party Tools**: Non-purpose-built tools like Kanban boards or wikis can be adapted for incident management, emphasizing usability, automation potential, and integration with workflows.

Incident response teams often face disorganized data during intense situations. The Exploit process aims to organize this data for effective learning and adaptation. Gathering incident-response data varies from complex systems to simple spreadsheets or notes. The goal is to extract intelligence for future use, starting with understanding available information, which can be high-level narratives or detailed technical analyses like malware functionality.

**Information-Gathering Goals:**
1. **Indicators of Compromise (IOCs):** Despite debates on their usefulness, IOCs are still valuable for tracking adversaries.
2. **Signatures:** Advanced indicators like Snort and Yara signatures can be extracted, depending on the tech stack.
3. **Tactics, Techniques, and Procedures (TTPs):** Understanding adversary operations helps in strategic analysis.
4. **Strategic Data:** Non-technical data, such as attribution and motivation, is crucial for high-value intelligence.

**Mining Previous Incidents:**
Analyzing past incidents helps integrate operations and intelligence, identifying threats and information gaps. Including dates enhances the analysis.

**Gathering External Information:**
External sources provide context and situational awareness. Similar to a literature review, this process identifies gaps and builds upon existing knowledge, enhancing the collective understanding of threats.

**Extracting and Storing Threat Data:**
Data from investigations must be structured for future analysis. Two approaches are common: manual methods like spreadsheets and platform-based solutions. The choice of data standards depends on organizational needs.

**Data Standards:**
- **STIX/TAXII:** Widely used for standardizing and sharing threat information. STIX 2.X uses JSON and simplifies data integration.
- **MILE Working Group:** Includes IODEF and IODEF-SCI for sharing incident data with additional context.
- **OpenIOC:** Developed by Mandiant, it captures forensic artifacts but is largely deprecated.

Technical formats like STIX may not suit strategic information, which often ends up in documents or slides. Effective storage of strategic data remains a challenge.

In summary, effective incident response requires organizing data, extracting valuable intelligence, and using appropriate standards for storing both technical and strategic information. This ensures improved threat analysis and response capabilities.



# Summary

In the realm of cyber threat intelligence, storing strategic information effectively is crucial. Three primary standards for storing such information are ATT&CK, VERIS, and CAPEC.

## ATT&CK

MITRE's Adversary Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge (ATT&CK) framework has become prominent in the threat intelligence community since its inception in 2013. Originally focused on Windows, it now covers Linux, macOS, mobile platforms, and more. ATT&CK categorizes attacker behaviors into tactics and techniques, providing a comprehensive model for both tactical and strategic information. The framework includes tags, fields, and relationships to capture detailed data about adversary groups, tactics, techniques, and software.

## VERIS

The Vocabulary for Event Recording and Incident Sharing (VERIS) is a JSON-based standard supporting the Verizon Data Breach Incident Report (DBIR). It captures incident details across four categories: Actor, Action, Asset, and Attribute. VERIS helps organizations understand risks by providing a structured narrative of incidents, focusing more on strategic insights rather than technical specifics.

## CAPEC

The Common Attack Pattern Enumeration and Classification (CAPEC) framework aids in developing secure software by identifying common attack patterns. CAPEC captures the full scope of an attack, including prerequisites, weaknesses, vulnerabilities, and attacker steps, allowing organizations to understand attacker behavior and adapt security measures accordingly.

## Process for Extracting and Storing Threat Data

A structured process for data extraction and storage is essential:

1. **Identify Goals**: Clearly define the intended outcomes and support requirements.
2. **Identify Tools**: Determine the tools needed to achieve these goals, such as threat-intelligence platforms (TIPs) or collaboration tools.
3. **Identify Systems/Processes**: Develop a systematic approach to aggregate and organize data.
4. **Launch and Iterate**: Implement the process, adjusting as necessary to improve efficiency and effectiveness.

## Managing Information

Proper management of information involves capturing key details such as date, source, data-handling requirements, and avoiding data duplication. The Traffic Light Protocol (TLP) is recommended for data-sharing guidelines.

## Threat-Intelligence Platforms (TIPs)

TIPs simplify the process of managing threat data. They are databases with user interfaces designed for handling threat information. Popular TIPs include:

- **MISP**: A free platform for managing malware-based threat data with robust sharing capabilities.
- **CRITs**: An open-source tool developed by MITRE, compatible with STIX and TAXII, for storing and sharing threat information.

## Conclusion

The exploitation phase is critical for gathering, processing, and storing information for analysis and dissemination. Organizations should explore various options to find systems that best suit their needs for managing threat intelligence effectively.



### Summary of Analyze Phase in F3EAD

The Analyze phase in the F3EAD cycle transforms data into actionable intelligence. This phase involves processing gathered information to derive insights, using models like target-centric and structured analysis, and addressing cognitive biases.

#### Fundamentals of Analysis

Analysis requires revisiting the intelligence cycle to decide on requirements and collect additional data to enrich existing information. During the Road Runner intrusion response, domains and IPs identified in earlier phases were analyzed to understand attacker tactics and predict future behaviors.

#### Dual Process Thinking

Analysis demands "slow thinking" or system 2 thinking, a concept popularized by Daniel Kahneman. This deliberate reasoning counters impulsive biases of fast thinking (system 1) and requires understanding context and potential impacts. Slow thinking helps generate insights that can be clearly articulated and defended.

#### Reasoning Types

1. **Deductive Reasoning:** Involves deriving conclusions from universally accepted premises, useful in simple scenarios but limited in complex investigations.
   
2. **Inductive Reasoning:** Involves generalizing from specific instances, often used in investigations but can lead to incorrect assumptions if data is incomplete.

3. **Abductive Reasoning:** Combines deduction and induction, applying past rules to available information to infer plausible causes, making it ideal for investigations with imperfect data.

#### Case Study: The OPM Breach

The OPM breach exemplifies the failure to analyze effectively. Despite available information, missed opportunities to connect dots led to a massive data loss. Proper analysis could have mitigated the breach's impact.

#### Analytic Processes and Methods

Experience in cybersecurity aids quick decision-making, but intelligence analysis requires cognitive skills like memory, logic, and reasoning. Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) provide a step-by-step approach to counter cognitive biases and ensure reproducibility in analysis.

SATs, outlined in "Structured Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis" by Pherson and Heuer, are crucial for intelligence-driven incident response, helping analysts avoid system 1 thinking flaws.

In summary, the Analyze phase is critical for transforming data into intelligence, requiring deliberate reasoning, understanding of reasoning types, and structured analytic methods to ensure accurate and actionable insights.



**Analytic Techniques for Intelligence Analysis**

The book categorizes Structured Analytic Techniques (SATs) into six main families, each aiding different stages of the intelligence analysis process:

1. **Getting Organized**: These techniques help analysts manage data at the beginning of the analysis. Methods include sorting, ranking, and using checklists. They are particularly useful when starting from scratch or revisiting unanalyzed incident data.

2. **Exploration**: Designed to generate new approaches and challenge existing biases, these techniques include brainstorming and mind mapping to explore relationships between data elements.

3. **Diagnostic**: Often used in intelligence-driven incident response, these techniques mirror the scientific method. Key methods include Analysis of Competing Hypotheses, Multiple-Hypothesis Generation, and Deception Detection.

4. **Reframing**: Essential for identifying biases and flawed mental models, reframing techniques like Red Hat Analysis and What If? Analysis are best conducted in groups but can also be done individually.

5. **Foresight**: Although predicting the future is impossible, foresight techniques help identify and monitor driving forces that may indicate future outcomes. Indicator Generation, Validation, and Evaluation are key methods here.

6. **Decision-Support**: These techniques structure information to aid decision-making, useful when presenting to senior leaders. Techniques include SWOT Analysis.

**Steps for Using SATs**:

1. **Define the Question**: Clearly outline the question you aim to answer, focusing on specific requirements from leadership. Avoid answering multiple questions with the same analysis to prevent bias.

2. **Identify Question Nature**: Determine if the question is future-oriented or diagnostic to choose the appropriate technique.

3. **Review Data**: Ensure you have all necessary information to generate hypotheses. Gather additional data if needed.

4. **Team Involvement**: While individual analysis is possible, team efforts leverage diverse perspectives and address biases effectively.

**Core Techniques**:

- **Key Assumptions Check**: This technique identifies and evaluates assumptions used in analysis. It involves gathering a diverse group to list and question assumptions, assessing their validity and impact.

- **Analysis of Competing Hypotheses (ACH)**: An eight-step process to evaluate multiple hypotheses and identify the most likely one. It involves listing hypotheses, evaluating evidence, refining conclusions, and documenting the analysis.

- **Indicator Generation, Validation, and Evaluation**: In structured analysis, indicators are broader than just IOCs. They help in identifying signs that point towards potential outcomes.

**Conclusion**:

These SATs provide a structured approach to intelligence analysis, ensuring clarity and objectivity. By systematically organizing, exploring, diagnosing, reframing, forecasting, and supporting decisions, analysts can enhance the accuracy and effectiveness of their insights. Regularly revisiting assumptions and conclusions ensures that analyses remain relevant and valid as new information emerges.



The text discusses various analytic techniques used in intelligence-driven incident response, focusing on the generation, validation, and evaluation of indicators to track events and identify trends. This process, known as Indications and Warnings Intelligence, involves creating a list of indicators that reflect the status quo of an organization’s operations. Changes in these indicators can signal shifts in threat landscapes, prompting further analysis.

Indicators must be observable, reliable, and specific. They should be evaluated to determine if they are ideal (likely to identify intended activities) or non-diagnostic (observable in unrelated scenarios). Once indicators are validated, a regular monitoring process should be established, with periodic evaluations to ensure ongoing relevance.

Contrarian techniques are also highlighted, which challenge existing analyses to uncover biases and ensure robustness. These include:

- **Devil’s Advocate**: Challenges accepted analyses by exploring opposing viewpoints.
- **“What if” Analysis**: Introduces hypothetical scenarios to test the resilience of current judgments.
- **Red Team Analysis**: Adopts an adversary’s perspective to anticipate potential threats and biases.

The text also introduces the Futures Wheel, a forecasting technique that explores potential outcomes of decisions by mapping hypothetical scenarios.

Target-centric analysis is presented as a collaborative approach that emphasizes relationships between analysts, customers, and collectors. This method seeks to overcome information overload and intelligence failures by fostering a shared understanding and reducing silos. It involves:

1. Securing stakeholder buy-in for collaborative approaches.
2. Developing a conceptual model of the “target,” often adversary networks, to understand and mitigate threats.
3. Establishing operating processes for iterative and predictive intelligence analysis.
4. Engaging in continuous feedback loops with stakeholders to refine intelligence outputs.
5. Remaining adaptable to changing intelligence requirements.

The text emphasizes the importance of clear, objective analysis to counter biases and ensure the reliability of intelligence findings. Analysts are encouraged to pause and consider the broader context of their work, transitioning from instinctual to deliberate thinking to enhance the quality of their analyses.



In analyzing data, it's crucial to start with specific questions to gain clarity and direction. Questions like "Why were we targeted?" or "How could this attack have been prevented?" help in understanding the nature and implications of a cyber attack. Identifying the attacker's goals, tactics, and techniques provides insight into potential future threats. Understanding "Who attacked us?" is important, but focusing solely on this can lead to overlooking broader threats. It's essential to analyze the attack's nature, such as whether it targeted data integrity, confidentiality, or availability.

To prevent future attacks, it's vital to assess what went wrong within your network, such as unpatched vulnerabilities or ignored alerts. Understanding how an attack could have been detected involves analyzing unique indicators like malware hashes and command-and-control IP addresses. Identifying patterns or trends in attacks can reveal campaign strategies or shared infrastructures among attackers.

Enriching data is a key step in the analysis process, providing additional context to indicators. This involves gathering more information about a particular indicator to interpret its meaning better. Enrichment sources include WHOIS information, passive DNS data, certificates, and malware details. WHOIS information helps track attacker infrastructure and identify compromised domains. Passive DNS provides insights into domain resolutions and activity patterns. Certificates offer pivot points due to the detailed information required for their issuance.

Internal enrichment involves understanding business operations and user information to determine why an attack was successful and what information was targeted. Information sharing with other organizations can provide nonpublic insights that enhance understanding of an incident. Formal groups like Information Sharing and Analysis Centers (ISACs) and informal partnerships play a significant role in this.

Developing a hypothesis is the next step after data enrichment. This involves synthesizing and interpreting collected information to form analytic judgments. A structured process ensures the analysis is complete, accurate, and reproducible. During this phase, it's important to document all ideas, even speculative ones, as the analysis process will refine and validate them.

Overall, the analysis phase is about transforming data into actionable insights, enabling organizations to update threat profiles, patch systems, and create detection rules. This iterative process is crucial for enhancing an organization's security posture and preventing future incidents.



The process of forming and evaluating hypotheses is critical in intelligence analysis, particularly when investigating incidents like the Road Runner intrusion. The primary goal is to determine if the intrusion was a targeted attack. Analysts must articulate clear hypotheses and avoid vague ideas that don't address the core question. The hypothesis about the Road Runner case suggests a targeted attack aimed at sensitive information, but it requires further validation through structured analysis.

Hypothesis development becomes easier over time as analysts recognize patterns and behaviors from past incidents. However, it's crucial not to prematurely accept a hypothesis without thorough analysis, considering assumptions and biases. Key assumptions must be identified, evaluated for validity, and documented. This step ensures all analysts share a common understanding.

The CIA’s Tradecraft Primer outlines the benefits of evaluating key assumptions, such as identifying faulty logic and stimulating discussions. The process involves identifying assumptions, assessing their confidence, challenging their validity, and removing those with low confidence. A hypothesis can remain plausible if supported by other evidence or higher confidence assumptions, even if some assumptions are removed.

Analysts must be aware of cognitive biases that can cloud judgment. These biases include confirmation bias, anchoring bias, availability bias, bandwagon effect, and mirroring. Confirmation bias leads analysts to focus on evidence supporting preexisting conclusions. Anchoring bias results in over-reliance on initial information. Availability bias emphasizes familiar information, potentially overlooking other evidence. The bandwagon effect involves assumptions gaining credibility as more people agree with them. Mirroring assumes the target thinks like the analyst, which can lead to flawed conclusions.

To counter these biases, analysts should use structured processes and engage in system 2 thinking, which involves deliberate and logical analysis. Evaluating key assumptions and focusing on the actual questions being asked can help mitigate these biases.

Judgment and conclusions are formed after evaluating assumptions and accounting for biases. Analysts use their knowledge and experience to interpret evidence and determine the likelihood of a hypothesis. Judgment involves disproving hypotheses, reviewing evidence, and articulating conclusions with confidence levels. Analysts should clearly document their conclusions and the evidence supporting them, ensuring that others can follow their logic.

A good formula for capturing a judgment includes assessing the confidence level, stating the judgment, citing evidence, and identifying indicators for further monitoring. This structured approach helps maintain clarity and accuracy in analysis, allowing for reevaluation if new information arises.

Personas, borrowed from marketing practices, describe hypothetical customers by outlining their characteristics, challenges, and needs. This enables tailoring of intelligence products to meet specific stakeholder requirements. For instance, a CEO who is technically inclined may prefer detailed reports, while a SOC lead might favor concise summaries. Keeping personas updated, especially when roles change, ensures relevance and effectiveness.

The authorship of intelligence products is crucial for maintaining credibility. Authors must possess a deep understanding of the subject to write authoritatively and accurately. This avoids errors and ensures the information is conveyed in a manner suitable for the audience. The writing process should align with the authors' expertise and the audience's needs, ensuring the product is both accurate and useful.

Incorporating automated information, such as data from threat-intelligence platforms, can enhance reports. However, this data must be well-understood and contextualized to avoid confusion. Including links for reference and updates can provide additional context and accuracy.

Actionability is a key component of intelligence products. They should enable customers to take informed actions or make decisions. This involves providing detailed information on adversary tactics, techniques, and procedures (TTPs) and ensuring the inclusion of actionable indicators of compromise (IOCs). Avoiding overly broad descriptions and ensuring information is easily transferable are critical for maintaining actionability.

The writing process for intelligence products involves planning, drafting, and editing. Planning focuses on understanding the audience, authorship, and actionability. Drafting may begin with a thesis statement, facts, or an outline, and should embrace narrative techniques to make the information relatable. Editing is essential and often involves multiple reviewers to ensure clarity and accuracy.

Ultimately, understanding customer needs, technological capabilities, and maturity levels allows for the tailoring of intelligence products to effectively support decision-making and action. This involves continuous listening to stakeholders and adjusting products to meet their evolving requirements.



### Summary
