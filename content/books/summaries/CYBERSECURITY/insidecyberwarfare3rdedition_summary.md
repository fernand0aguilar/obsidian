The adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) was incentivized by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services through a three-stage process aimed at improving healthcare quality. This led to a rush by software companies to capture federal funds, resulting in poorly executed implementations. Research highlighted significant issues, including underreported adverse events in robotic surgeries and alarming patient safety concerns related to EHRs. A report, “Death by a Thousand Clicks,” revealed widespread patient harm due to software glitches and secrecy enforced by EHR vendors. This secrecy prevents transparency and accountability, as vendors often impose gag clauses on buyers.

The reluctance to track EHR safety parallels the healthcare sector's general aversion to reporting usability and patient harm issues. Only Pennsylvania mandates acute healthcare facilities to report patient safety events. This mirrors the corporate reluctance to disclose cybersecurity incidents, which often go unreported or are downplayed.

Vulnerability disclosure in software security is contentious, with debates over whether public disclosure aids or hinders security. While some argue that public scrutiny is essential for security improvements, others believe that it exposes systems to unnecessary risks. Examples include the Sony PlayStation Network and Equifax breaches, where outdated software and delayed patching led to significant data compromises.

Twitter's cybersecurity failures, as revealed in a 2022 whistleblower complaint, highlighted severe negligence, such as outdated servers and poor security practices. Despite previous breaches and regulatory oversight, Twitter's security remained inadequate, illustrating the dangers of lax cybersecurity measures.

The cybersecurity industry faces criticism for its profit-driven model, where vulnerabilities are discovered and disclosed, often before patches are available, creating a cycle of risk and protection. This model is likened to a protection racket, where vulnerabilities are both created and exploited, necessitating a reevaluation of industry practices and incentives.

Overall, the text underscores the need for improved transparency, accountability, and regulatory frameworks in both healthcare IT and cybersecurity to ensure safety and security.



# Summary

The cybersecurity industry is characterized by a division between offensive and defensive strategies, with a skewed emphasis on offensive tactics rewarded by venture capital (VC) funding and public recognition. This focus often diverges from the original mission of preventing unauthorized network access. The industry lacks a moral framework akin to the Hippocratic Oath, highlighting the need for ethical guidelines. Attribution in cybersecurity is complex and often based on assumptions rather than concrete evidence. This process involves abductive reasoning, which relies on inferences from observations, leading to conclusions that may be incorrect due to incomplete information.

Historically, assumptions have led to misattributions, such as attributing financial crimes to Russian hackers and intellectual property theft to Chinese hackers. This has resulted in a narrow focus that overlooks other potential culprits. Notable cases like Moonlight Maze and Titan Rain illustrate the challenges of accurate attribution, with early assumptions often proving wrong or incomplete. The case of Solar Sunrise, where teenage hackers were initially thought to be from Iraq, underscores the need for thorough evidence gathering before reaching conclusions.

Cybersecurity companies often prioritize attribution to high-profile nation-states like China due to the business benefits of media attention and increased valuations. However, this approach can lead to speculative conclusions, as seen in the case of CrowdStrike's attribution to a Chinese military unit based on tenuous evidence. This speculative nature is exacerbated by poor analytic practices and a lack of accountability for incorrect attributions.

The process of attribution lacks the clear outcome validation found in fields like medicine, where diagnoses are either confirmed or refuted based on patient outcomes. In cybersecurity, the truth behind an attacker's identity is rarely known, leading to a reliance on assumptions that aren't validated with facts. This absence of accountability means that incorrect assumptions persist without correction, unlike in medicine where errors lead to learning and improvement.

Cybersecurity attribution involves several assumptions, including the belief that resources and government relations influence the likelihood of an attack being state-sponsored. These assumptions are often untested, and the incentives to challenge them are minimal. The industry needs a more rigorous approach to testing and validating assumptions to improve the accuracy of attributions and reduce the reliance on speculative reasoning.

Overall, the cybersecurity industry must address its ethical and methodological shortcomings by adopting a more transparent and evidence-based approach to attribution. This includes developing a moral imperative and improving the rigor of analytic practices to ensure that attributions are based on solid evidence rather than assumptions and speculation.



## Summary

Cybersecurity attribution relies heavily on assumptions about attack patterns, team setups, and data. These assumptions help determine who is responsible for cyber attacks, influencing decisions like legal indictments or government sanctions. However, many assumptions are flawed and can mislead investigators.

### Key Assumptions

1. **Exclusive Use of Malware**: It's commonly assumed that malware is proprietary to specific Advanced Persistent Threat (APT) groups. However, malware like X-Agent is widely available, meaning multiple actors could use it, complicating attribution.

2. **Working Hours**: Analysts often assume cyber-espionage follows regular office hours. Yet, this is problematic due to overlapping time zones and the global nature of cyber operations. Such assumptions are weak, especially when used by private-sector analysts without classified information.

3. **Criminals vs. Spies**: There's an assumption that criminals don't engage in espionage unless directed by a government. However, hackers for hire often conduct espionage independently, as seen in cases like Su Bin's, where hackers were hired to steal sensitive data.

### Challenges in Attribution

Attribution is complex, and errors can occur due to human traits like laziness or mistakes in tradecraft. Cybersecurity companies and government agencies often rely on assumptions without objective testing, leading to rushed and sometimes incorrect conclusions.

### Case Studies and Examples

CrowdStrike's investigation into the DNC hack relied on the flawed exclusive use assumption. Similarly, the working-hours assumption is often used in reports attributing attacks to foreign actors, despite its weaknesses. The release of CIA files by Wikileaks highlighted issues like the use of shared code and compromised techniques, which can mislead attribution efforts.

### The Need for Independent Fact-Finding

There is a growing call for an international attribution mechanism to provide unbiased assessments. However, countries with significant cyber capabilities, like the US and UK, are reluctant to cede control, preferring to maintain autonomy over their responses.

### Conclusion

Cybersecurity attribution is fraught with challenges due to reliance on assumptions and the lack of accountability in the industry. The need for independent, objective fact-finding is critical to ensure accurate attribution and prevent geopolitical tensions. However, the reluctance of powerful nations to participate in international mechanisms limits progress in this area.



### Summary

The text discusses the complexity of assigning blame for cyberattacks and the need for an international attribution mechanism similar to the Organization for the Prohibition of Chemical Weapons (OPCW). This proposed mechanism would involve smaller nations, lacking investigative resources, to collectively demand evidence sharing, thus enhancing accountability and objectivity in cyberattack investigations.

The text critiques the current state of cybersecurity attribution, emphasizing that public perceptions of its accuracy are often misguided. It highlights the high incentives for assigning blame without repercussions for poor analytic practices, urging the need for rigorous questioning and demanding higher standards from entities involved in these investigations.

The discussion moves to corporate accountability in the software industry, referencing the National Cybersecurity Strategy released by the White House in 2023, which aims to enforce accountability. It mentions a breach involving Microsoft, where Chinese hackers exploited vulnerabilities in Microsoft’s Azure Active Directory. The breach led to significant scrutiny, including a letter from Senator Ron Wyden urging the Cyber Safety Review Board and other agencies to hold Microsoft accountable for negligent cybersecurity practices.

Wyden's letter highlights previous incidents like the SolarWinds breach and emphasizes the need for Microsoft to adhere to cybersecurity standards. It suggests that Microsoft’s practices be investigated for potential violations of federal laws and previous consent decrees.

The text also discusses the Known Exploited Vulnerabilities (KEVs) database by CISA, which helps organizations prioritize addressing software vulnerabilities. Microsoft leads the database with the most entries, indicating a significant need for improvement in its cybersecurity practices.

Lastly, the text draws historical parallels to the resistance faced by industries in adopting safety regulations, such as the railroad industry’s reluctance to replace dangerous coupling systems and the catastrophic Texas City disaster in 1947, which led to regulatory changes. These examples underline the ongoing challenge of enforcing corporate accountability in the software industry, suggesting that significant disasters often precede regulatory action.

Overall, the text advocates for a structured international approach to cyber attribution and increased corporate accountability to prevent future cybersecurity failures.



In 1953, the US Supreme Court ruled that the government couldn't be sued due to sovereign immunity, despite dissent from Justice Jackson, who emphasized that the public shouldn't bear the risk of untested products. This principle parallels issues in the software industry, where users lack the knowledge to assess security risks. Historical lessons from the Texas City disaster and automotive industry highlight the dangers of ignorance and complacency, suggesting similar vulnerabilities in software.

Ralph Nader's book, "Unsafe at Any Speed," and a National Academy of Sciences report spurred the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act of 1966, mandating safety standards like seatbelts and airbags. This regulatory path mirrors the current lack of software industry regulation, despite rising cybercrime and profits for cybersecurity firms like CrowdStrike and Palo Alto Networks.

The software industry's lack of accountability is exacerbated by "as is" warranties and limited liability clauses in end-user agreements, leaving consumers vulnerable. The creation of CISA in 2018 marked a step towards addressing these issues, advocating for a shift in responsibility from consumers to technology producers.

CISA Director Jen Easterly emphasized three principles: manufacturers should own security outcomes, embrace transparency, and focus on secure product design. While the US aims for voluntary industry participation, the EU's Cyber Resilience Act proposes legislative solutions to improve cybersecurity.

The US National Cybersecurity Strategy outlines five pillars: defending critical infrastructure, disrupting threat actors, shaping market forces for security, investing in resilience, and forging international partnerships. A key challenge is shifting liability to software makers, who have historically faced little accountability.

Efforts to establish independent testing akin to Consumer Reports in cybersecurity have been hindered by conflicts of interest, as testing organizations often receive funding from the companies they evaluate. The US Standards Development Organization Advancement Act of 2004 requires a balance of interests, which is unmet in current cybersecurity testing practices.

The strategy's implementation, overseen by National Cyber Director Harry Coker, seeks to make the US a harder target for cyber threats. However, voluntary compliance has proven ineffective over the past 25 years, necessitating a move towards market-driven solutions and potential legislation to enforce accountability in the software industry.



The text discusses accountability in the software industry, emphasizing the need for companies to assume responsibility for security and performance. An example is New Jersey's stringent terms for software and cloud service providers, holding vendors liable for significant financial penalties if a vulnerability leads to a data breach. This approach highlights the challenges smaller companies face in meeting such demands, potentially leading to regulatory changes. Experts predict a catastrophic failure in the software industry, possibly involving AI, which will force Congress to impose regulations on Big Tech.

The text also explores the legal status of cyber warfare, particularly the rise of civilian hackers engaging in offensive operations following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The unauthorized hacking of computer systems is illegal in many countries, and international bodies like the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) and the International Criminal Court (ICC) are working to interpret cyber attacks in times of war. The ICRC has issued guidelines to mitigate the impact of cyber operations on civilians and advises against encouraging civilian participation in hostilities.

The ICC has indicated that cyber attacks against civilians during wartime could be prosecuted as international crimes under the Rome Statute. This stance stems from a 2021 UN report addressing war crimes via cyber attacks during armed conflict. The report emphasizes the importance of the physical impact of a cyber attack in determining its qualification as an act of war.

The text outlines the legal considerations for cyber operations, including the principles of distinction, proportionality, and precaution. It provides criteria for targeting civilian hackers involved in hostilities, identifying them as legitimate targets if they meet conditions related to harm, causal link, and belligerent nexus.

Finally, the text offers a decision tree for assessing whether a civilian's cyber activities during conflict could categorize them as combatants, highlighting the risks and legal implications involved.

Overall, the text underscores the evolving landscape of cybersecurity, legal frameworks, and the potential for significant regulatory changes in response to emerging threats and vulnerabilities.
