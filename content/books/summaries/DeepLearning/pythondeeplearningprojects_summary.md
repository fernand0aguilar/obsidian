    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dense(16))
    model.add(Activation('relu'))
    model.add(Dense(actions))
    model.add(Activation('linear'))
    return model


### Agent Action and Memory

The agent uses an epsilon-greedy policy to decide actions:

- **Random Action:** With probability `epsilon`.
- **Predicted Action:** Otherwise, using the model's prediction.

A deque object stores tuples of `(state, new_state, reward, done, action)` for training purposes.

### Training Process

The training involves:

1. **Initializing the Environment:** Reset and reshape the initial state.
2. **Action Selection:** Using the `agent_action` function.
3. **Environment Interaction:** Execute actions and store results in the deque.
4. **Replay Function:** Trains the agent using batches from the deque, applying the Bellman equation to update Q-values.
5. **Training Loop:** Repeats until the target score is achieved.

python
def replay(epsilon, gamma, epsilon_min, epsilon_decay, model, training_data, batch_size=64):
    train_batch = random.sample(training_data, min(len(training_data), batch_size))
    for state, new_state, reward, done, action in train_batch:
        target = reward if done else reward + gamma * np.amax(model.predict(new_state)[0])
        target_f = model.predict(state)
        target_f[0][action] = target
        model.fit(state, target_f, epochs=1, verbose=0)
    if epsilon > epsilon_min:
        epsilon *= epsilon_decay
    return epsilon


### Testing and Evaluation

Post-training, the agent is tested over multiple episodes to evaluate performance. The average score is calculated to assess if the target score is consistently met.

### Modular Code Structure

The implementation is divided into:

- **`train_dqn.py`:** Handles training and testing.
- **`agent_replay_dqn.py`:** Contains the neural network and replay functions.
- **`test_dqn.py`:** Tests the trained model.
- **`hyperparameters_dqn.py`:** Contains hyperparameters for the DQN model.

### Deep SARSA Learning

Similar to DQN, SARSA is implemented using the keras-rl library. SARSA differs as it is an on-policy method, updating Q-values based on the current policy rather than a greedy one.

### Conclusion

The document provides a comprehensive guide to implementing and training an autonomous agent using DQN and SARSA, with modular code for ease of use and adaptation. The agent is tested to ensure it meets performance targets, with flexibility to adjust parameters and policies for optimization.
