In machine learning, classification errors, such as incorrectly identifying a patient’s disease status, can have severe consequences. The Bayes Classifier addresses this by determining the conditional probability of class membership, using Bayes Theorem to decide if an input belongs to a particular class based on the likelihood ratio. The Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is used to evaluate the performance of classifiers, with the goal of maximizing true positives while minimizing false positives.

A critical challenge in machine learning is generalization, ensuring that a model performs well on both training and unseen data. The Hoeffding inequality helps assess the probability that training error deviates from test error, emphasizing the importance of a large training set for better generalization.
