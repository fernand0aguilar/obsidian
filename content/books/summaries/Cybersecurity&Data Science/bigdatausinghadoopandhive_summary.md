- **Master-Slave Model**: NameNode (master) manages metadata, while DataNodes (slaves) handle data storage.

### Data Handling and Reliability

- **Data Locality**: Processes data where it is stored to minimize network congestion.
- **Heartbeat Mechanism**: NameNode monitors DataNodes through regular heartbeats to ensure system health and trigger data replication if needed.

### Summary

Hadoop provides a comprehensive framework for managing big data challenges through its scalable, reliable, and cost-effective architecture. Its ecosystem of components supports a wide range of data processing tasks, making it a vital tool for modern data-driven enterprises.



### Hadoop Rack Awareness and Data Locality

Hadoop utilizes rack awareness to enhance data availability and fault tolerance by distributing replicated data blocks across different racks. This strategy mitigates the risk of data loss if an entire rack fails. However, it increases I/O costs due to inter-rack data transfers. The NameNode assigns unique IDs to replicas to prevent duplicate placement on the same rack.

Hadoop's data locality principle optimizes processing by executing tasks on the same node where data resides, minimizing unnecessary data transfers. If tasks cannot execute on the same DataNode, Hadoop employs a hierarchy of data locality policies: DataNode-level, rack-level, and off-rack-level.

### Data Storage and Policies

HDFS supports various storage types, such as DISK, SSD, and RAM, each suited for different data access patterns. Storage policies in Hadoop allow data to be stored across these types based on access frequency. For instance, hot storage is used for frequently accessed data, while cold storage is for archival data. Policies like ALL_SSD and Lazy_Persist optimize storage efficiency by balancing cost and performance.

### Failure Handling in HDFS

HDFS employs mechanisms to manage failures. DataNode failures trigger re-replication of data blocks to other nodes. NameNode failures, a single point of failure in Hadoop 1.x, are addressed in later versions through high availability (HA) with active/passive NameNode configurations. The Quorum Journal Manager (QJM) ensures HA by synchronizing states between active and standby NameNodes, preventing data loss and enabling seamless failover.

### Erasure Coding

Hadoop 3.0 introduced erasure coding (EC) to reduce storage overhead while maintaining data durability. Unlike traditional replication, which requires multiple copies, EC uses parity data to reconstruct lost information, reducing the replication factor from 3 to about 1.4. This significantly cuts storage requirements by approximately 50%.

### HDFS Disk Balancer

Hadoop 3.x includes an intra-node disk balancer to address data volume imbalances across disks. This tool improves HDFS performance by distributing data evenly across all disks, optimizing disk I/O. The disk balancer operates via command-line interface (CLI) and requires a plan that outlines data movement between disks.

In summary, Hadoop's architecture and features like rack awareness, data locality, storage policies, failure handling, erasure coding, and disk balancing collectively enhance data management, fault tolerance, and storage efficiency in large-scale distributed systems.



### HDFS Architecture and Challenges

HDFS, a master-slave architecture, uses a single NameNode to manage files, directories, and blocks, which can become a bottleneck in large clusters due to scalability issues. The NameNode maintains the namespace and metadata, while DataNodes handle the actual storage. The architecture consists of two layers: the Namespace layer for managing directories and files, and the Block Storage layer for block management and physical storage. A single NameNode failure can cause cluster-wide issues, lacking isolation in multi-tenant environments.

### HDFS Federation

HDFS Federation addresses these limitations by enabling multiple independent NameNodes and namespaces, enhancing scalability, performance, and isolation. Each NameNode manages its namespace and block pool independently, without coordination with others. This setup allows horizontal scaling of NameNodes, distributing the load and improving system throughput. The Federation architecture is backward-compatible, supporting both single and multiple NameNode configurations.

### HDFS Read and Write Processes

HDFS stores files in blocks replicated across DataNodes to ensure failover handling. When reading, the client uses the FileSystem API to stream data, with the NameNode providing block locations. FSDataInputStream handles the reading process, moving through blocks and DataNodes. For writing, the client creates a file with DistributedFileSystem, which coordinates with the NameNode to allocate blocks. Data is streamed through a pipeline of DataNodes, ensuring replication and reliability.

### Failure Handling

HDFS manages read and write failures by rerouting to alternative blocks or DataNodes. For write failures, the pipeline is restructured, removing failed nodes and continuing the data transfer. This design supports a large number of concurrent clients, ensuring data integrity and reliability.

### Hadoop Setup and Configuration

Hadoop can be set up in three modes: Local, Pseudo-Distributed, and Distributed, with the latter being suitable for production environments. Setting up a single-node cluster involves installing Java, configuring SSH, and setting environment variables. Key configuration files include `core-site.xml`, `hdfs-site.xml`, `mapred-site.xml`, and `yarn-site.xml`, each defining specific properties for the Hadoop environment.

### Configuration Parameters

- **io.file.buffer.size**: Adjusts buffer size for read/write operations, default is 4096 bytes.
- **dfs.block.size**: Sets block size for new HDFS files, default is 128 MB.
- **dfs.datanode.du.reserved**: Reserves disk space for non-HDFS applications.
- **dfs.namenode.handler.count**: Configures thread pool for RPC calls, default is 10.
- **dfs.datanode.failed.volumes.tolerated**: Sets threshold for DataNode failure.
- **dfs.hosts**: Limits hosts that can connect to the NameNode for added security.
- **fs.trash.interval**: Manages deleted file retention in a temporary trash folder.

### Command-Line Interface

Hadoop’s command-line interface allows management of HDFS files with Unix-like commands. Key commands include file operations such as reading, creating, moving, and deleting files. The interface supports configuration overrides and generic options applicable to multiple commands.

HDFS Federation and the robust failure handling mechanisms enhance Hadoop’s scalability, reliability, and performance, making it suitable for large-scale data processing environments.

- **FileSystem Methods**: Methods like `get()`, `open()`, and `delete()` manage files and directories.

`FSDataInputStream` and `FSDataOutputStream` handle reading and writing, with methods for random access (`seek()`, `getPos()`) and file creation.

### YARN Overview

YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator) is Hadoop's resource management framework, supporting diverse applications like data streaming and batch processing. Key benefits include resource utilization, scalability, and multi-tenancy.

### YARN Architecture

YARN separates resource management from job execution, involving:

- **ResourceManager**: Allocates resources and tracks applications, using schedulers like `CapacityScheduler`.
- **ApplicationMaster**: Manages task execution and communicates with ResourceManager.
- **NodeManager**: Oversees node health and manages containers.
- **Container**: Represents resource units like CPU and memory.

YARN's architecture allows integration with various frameworks, such as Apache Tej and Apache Storm.

### YARN Process Flow

The YARN client submits tasks to the ResourceManager, which allocates slots via NodeManager. The ApplicationMaster manages task execution, sending heartbeats to monitor health. ResourceManager handles failures by reallocating resources as needed.

### YARN Failures and High Availability

YARN addresses failures at multiple levels:

- **Container/Task Failure**: Managed by NodeManager, which restarts tasks in new containers.
- **ApplicationMaster Failure**: ResourceManager starts a new instance.
- **ResourceManager Failure**: High availability is achieved using ZooKeeper, with active/standby ResourceManagers.

High availability is crucial to prevent single points of failure, with manual and automatic failover options facilitated by ZooKeeper.

This overview captures the essential functions and architecture of Hadoop's HDFS and YARN, providing a foundation for understanding their roles in big data processing.



# Summary

## ResourceManager and High Availability

In a high-availability Hadoop cluster, multiple ResourceManager services run, with one active and others in standby mode. The active ResourceManager syncs its state with standby ResourceManagers using a file-based or ZooKeeper-based state store. ZooKeeper ensures only one ResourceManager remains active and elects a new one if the current active becomes unresponsive.

## YARN Schedulers

### ApplicationManager and Scheduler

The YARN ResourceManager consists of the ApplicationManager and Scheduler. The ApplicationManager validates and forwards job requests to the Scheduler, which allocates resources based on pluggable policies like CapacityScheduler and FairScheduler. The Scheduler focuses solely on resource allocation without tracking job status.

### Fair Scheduler

The Fair Scheduler addresses resource exploitation by ensuring all jobs receive equal resources over time. Jobs are placed in pools with equal resource slots, allowing fair resource distribution and preventing long jobs from monopolizing resources. Pools can have fixed minimum resources, and scheduling policies like FIFO or Dominant Resource Fairness can be applied.

### Capacity Scheduler

The Capacity Scheduler optimizes resource utilization by allocating resources to organizational queues, allowing unused resources to be reallocated. It supports multi-tenancy, elasticity, security, and priority scheduling, ensuring each organization receives guaranteed capacity.

## YARN Timeline Server

### Application History Server

The Application History Server tracks YARN applications, providing an interface to access job status. It supports applications beyond MapReduce but has limitations in scalability and reliability due to its dependency on HDFS for storing logs.

### Application Timeline Server (ATS)

ATS enhances scalability and usability by using a distributed architecture with multiple timeline collectors and readers. It supports complex queries and provides insight into YARN application metrics and events.

## YARN Federation

YARN Federation scales YARN infrastructure by dividing a large cluster into sub-clusters, each with its ResourceManager and NodeManager. This architecture allows for scalability, fault tolerance, and high availability. The Router and AMRM Proxy facilitate communication and job submission across federated sub-clusters.

## MapReduce Framework

MapReduce is a Hadoop framework for parallel data processing. It operates on key-value pairs using Mapper and Reducer tasks. Data is split into blocks, processed in parallel, and aggregated for output storage. The framework is reliable, fault-tolerant, and cost-effective, leveraging common hardware and distributed environments.



# MapReduce Overview

MapReduce is a framework for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a cluster. The process involves several key phases: **Mapping**, **Sorting and Shuffling**, and **Reducing**.

## Phases of MapReduce

1. **Mapping**: The input file is split into smaller chunks and processed by the Mapper, which converts input data into key-value pairs. Each Mapper task runs independently, generating intermediate key-value pairs stored locally.

2. **Sorting and Shuffling**: The framework sorts the Mapper output by keys and shuffles them to ensure all values with the same key are sent to the same Reducer. This step allows Reducers to start processing data before all Mapper tasks are completed.

3. **Reducing**: Reducers aggregate the received key-value pairs, performing operations like summing values, and produce the final output written to the Hadoop Distributed File System (HDFS). It's possible to have zero Reducer tasks if only mapping is required.

## Key Features

- **Data Locality**: Mapper tasks process data locally on the node where it's stored, reducing network overhead.
- **Parallel Processing**: MapReduce supports parallel execution of tasks across multiple nodes, enhancing performance and scalability.
- **Loose Coupling**: Mappers and Reducers operate independently, which improves stability and allows for scalable infrastructure changes.
- **Fault Tolerance**: The ApplicationMaster monitors tasks, rescheduling any failed tasks without impacting the workflow.
- **Cost-Effectiveness**: As an open-source framework, MapReduce runs on common hardware and doesn't require expensive storage solutions.

## MapReduce Architecture

MapReduce operates on top of YARN (Yet Another Resource Negotiator), which manages resources across distributed processing frameworks. YARN consists of ResourceManager and NodeManager. The ResourceManager allocates resources, while NodeManager manages them on individual nodes.

### Components

- **ApplicationMaster**: Manages the execution and lifecycle of tasks, coordinating with NodeManager and ResourceManager.
- **Scheduler**: Allocates resources based on policies and manages task execution.

## Sample MapReduce Program

### Word Count Example

- **Mapper**: Reads input text, tokenizes it, and outputs each word as a key with a count of 1.
  java
  public static class SampleMapper extends Mapper<LongWritable, Text, Text, IntWritable> {
      private final static IntWritable count = new IntWritable(1);
      private Text text = new Text();
      public void map(LongWritable key, Text value, OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
          String line = value.toString();
          StringTokenizer tokenizer = new StringTokenizer(line);
          while (tokenizer.hasMoreTokens()) {
              text.set(tokenizer.nextToken());
              output.collect(text, count);
          }
      }
  }
  

- **Reducer**: Aggregates counts for each word and writes the total count to the output.
  java
  public static class SampleReducer extends Reducer<Text, IntWritable, Text, IntWritable> {
      public void reduce(Text key, Iterator<IntWritable> values, OutputCollector<Text, IntWritable> output, Reporter reporter) throws IOException {
          int sum = 0;
          while (values.hasNext()) {
              sum += values.next().get();
          }
          output.collect(key, new IntWritable(sum));
      }
  }
  

- **Job Configuration**: Sets up the job with Mapper, Reducer, and I/O formats.
  java
  JobConf conf = new JobConf(SampleMapReduce.class);
  conf.setJobName("SampleMapReduce");
  conf.setOutputKeyClass(Text.class);
  conf.setOutputValueClass(IntWritable.class);
  conf.setMapperClass(SampleMapper.class);
  conf.setReducerClass(SampleReducer.class);
  

## Composite Key Operations

For complex operations requiring multi-column processing, a composite key can be used. This involves creating a key class that implements `WritableComparable` for sorting and writing data.

### Example

- **Composite Key**: Combines fields like "country" and "state" to group data efficiently.
  java
  private static class CompositeGroupKey implements WritableComparable<CompositeGroupKey> {
      String country;
      String state;
      // Methods for serialization, deserialization, and comparison
  }
  

MapReduce's design allows for efficient, scalable processing of large data sets, leveraging parallelism and fault tolerance to manage workloads in distributed environments.



### MapReduce Overview

MapReduce is a framework for processing large data sets with a distributed algorithm on a cluster. It consists of two main tasks: Map and Reduce. The **Map** task processes input data and outputs key-value pairs, while the **Reduce** task aggregates these pairs.

- **Mapper**: Transforms input split records into key-value pairs using the `WritableComparable` interface. The `map()` method processes each input line, splits it, and writes intermediate data to the disk. A local **Combiner** may be used to reduce data transferred to the Reducer.
  
- **Reducer**: Collects and processes intermediate data from the Mapper, shuffles, merges, and sorts key-value pairs before writing the final output to the disk. The `reduce()` method aggregates values for each key.

- **Job Configuration**: The `JobConf` class configures Mapper, Reducer, Combiner, InputFormat, OutputFormat, and other parameters. Key configurations include `mapreduce.task.io.sort.mb` for buffer memory, `mapreduce.task.io.sort.factor` for file merging, and `mapreduce.job.reduces` for the number of Reducer tasks.

### Hive Overview

Apache Hive is an open-source data warehouse software that facilitates reading, writing, and managing large datasets residing in distributed storage using SQL. It simplifies Hadoop's complexity by providing a SQL-like interface called HiveQL.

- **HiveQL**: Offers an abstraction of SQL to access Hadoop data, making it easier and faster to use than writing MapReduce programs. HiveQL supports SQL queries, joins, and DBMS-like commands.

- **Data Storage**: Hive tables map to HDFS directories. Data can be partitioned and bucketed for efficient querying. Hive supports various file formats, such as Text, Sequence, RCFile, Avro, ORC, and Parquet.

- **Data Model**: Hive supports primitive types (integers, booleans, floats, strings) and complex types (arrays, maps, structs, unions). These types allow for the creation of complex schemas.

### Hive Architecture

Hive operates on different computing engines like MapReduce, Tez, and Spark. It can be accessed via Command Line, Web Interface, and Thrift Server. HiveQL statements are compiled and executed using these engines.

### Key Differences: RDBMS vs. Hive

- **Latency**: Hive has higher latency, suitable for batch processing rather than real-time queries.
- **Data Size**: Hive can handle petabytes of data, unlike traditional RDBMS systems.
- **Indexes**: Hive does not use indexes, relying instead on partitioning and parallel data scanning.

### Hive History and Adoption

Originally developed by Facebook to simplify Hadoop's complexity, Hive has become popular across industries. It supports extensibility and flexibility while maintaining Hadoop's performance benefits.

### Conclusion

MapReduce and Hive are integral to processing and analyzing big data efficiently. MapReduce handles the distributed processing, while Hive simplifies data interaction with SQL-like queries, offering a more user-friendly approach to big data analytics.

## Summary of Hive and Hadoop Integration

### Setting Up Hive

To run Hive, ensure Hadoop is configured in your class path with the `HADOOP_HOME` variable. Create necessary HDFS directories and set permissions:

bash
export HADOOP_HOME=<hadoop-install-dir>
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop fs -mkdir /tmp
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop fs -mkdir /user/hive/warehouse
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop fs -chmod g+w /tmp
$HADOOP_HOME/bin/hadoop fs -chmod g+w /user/hive/warehouse


### Hive CLI

Launch the Hive shell using the command `hive` or execute HiveQL commands directly with `hive -e 'command'`. HiveQL is case-insensitive. Use `show databases;` and `show tables;` to explore databases and tables.

### Hive Tables

- **Managed Tables**: Hive manages data; dropping the table deletes data from HDFS.
- **External Tables**: Map to existing HDFS data; dropping the table retains data.

### Creating and Managing Tables

To create a table, define its schema and specify if it's managed or external. Example:

sql
CREATE EXTERNAL TABLE IF NOT EXISTS employee (EMPID STRING, EMPNAME STRING)
ROW FORMAT DELIMITED FIELDS TERMINATED BY ','
LINES TERMINATED BY '\n'
LOCATION '/user/joe/employee';


### Hive Configuration

Configure Hive using `hive-site.xml`. Key properties include:

- **hive.limit.optimize.enable**: Optimizes query limits to improve performance.

### Loading and Inserting Data

Load data into tables using:

sql
LOAD DATA [LOCAL] INPATH 'filepath' INTO TABLE tablename;


Insert data using:

sql
INSERT INTO TABLE employee VALUES ('emp1', '23', '123.32');


### Hive Transactions

Hive supports ACID transactions (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) for inserts, updates, and deletes. Enable transactions by setting:

- **hive.support.concurrency=true**
- **hive.txn.manager=org.apache.hadoop.hive.ql.lockmgr.DbTxnManager**

### Update and Delete Operations

- **UPDATE**: Modify table records when ACID transactions are enabled.
- **DELETE**: Remove records using conditions, also requiring ACID transactions.

### Merge and Locks

The `MERGE` statement allows conditional insert, update, or delete based on join conditions. Hive uses locks to manage concurrent operations, with shared and exclusive locks for read and write operations, respectively.

### Querying Data

Use the `SELECT` statement for data retrieval with optional clauses like `WHERE`, `GROUP BY`, `ORDER BY`, and `LIMIT` to refine results.

This summary highlights essential aspects of using Hive with Hadoop, focusing on setup, table management, data operations, and configuration for efficient big data processing.



# Hive Query Language Overview

Hive Query Language (HiveQL) is similar to SQL used in RDBMS, allowing users to perform operations on data stored in Hive. Key features include:

## Basic Query Structure

- **SELECT Queries**: Follows the SQL pattern: `SELECT fields FROM table WHERE condition`. Example: `SELECT firstname, lastname FROM employee WHERE state='CA';`

- **Database Selection**: Use `SHOW databases;` to list databases. Switch databases using `USE database_name;`.

## Query Modifiers

- **DISTINCT**: Removes duplicate records. Example: `SELECT DISTINCT firstname FROM employee;`

- **LIMIT**: Restricts the number of records returned. Example: `SELECT firstname FROM employee LIMIT 1;`

## File-Based Queries

- Execute queries from a file using the `-f` option: `$ hive -f /path/to/query.hql`.

## Complex Data Types

- **Arrays**: Access elements using indices. Example: `SELECT name, emails[0] FROM employee;`

- **Maps**: Key-value pairs. Example: `SELECT name, previous_company['comp1'] FROM employee;`

- **Structs**: Collections of elements of different types. Example: `SELECT name, address.city FROM employee;`

## Ordering and Sorting

- **ORDER BY**: Sorts data globally using a single reducer, which can be slow for large datasets.

- **SORT BY**: Sorts data within each reducer, improving performance.

## Data Distribution

- **DISTRIBUTE BY**: Distributes rows across reducers based on column values, ensuring non-overlapping ranges.

- **CLUSTER BY**: Combines `DISTRIBUTE BY` and `SORT BY`, providing global ordering without compromising performance.

## Grouping and Aggregation

- **GROUP BY**: Groups data based on columns and is used with aggregate functions like `SUM`, `COUNT`, `AVG`.

- **HAVING**: Places conditions on grouped data. Example: `SELECT state, AVG(salary) FROM employee GROUP BY state HAVING AVG(salary) > 2000;`

- **Aggregate Functions**: Includes `COUNT`, `SUM`, `AVG`, `MIN`, `MAX`, and advanced functions like `GROUPING SETS`, `CUBE`, `ROLLUP`.

## Table-Generating Functions

- Functions like `EXPLODE` expand arrays or maps into multiple rows.

## Built-in Functions

- **Mathematical Functions**: Include `ROUND`, `FLOOR`, `CEIL`, `RAND`, `POW`, `SQRT`.

- **Collection Functions**: Include `SIZE`, `MAP_KEYS`, `ARRAY_CONTAINS`.

- **Date Functions**: Include `FROM_UNIXTIME`, `UNIX_TIMESTAMP`, `YEAR`, `MONTH`, `DAY`.

- **Conditional Functions**: Include `IF`, `ISNULL`, `NVL`, `COALESCE`.

- **String Functions**: Include `ASCII`, `CONCAT`, `LENGTH`, `REVERSE`, `SUBSTR`.

## Joins

- **Inner Join**: Returns rows with matching keys in all tables.

- **Left Outer Join**: Returns all rows from the left table and matching rows from the right table, with NULLs for non-matching rows.

HiveQL simplifies data querying in Hadoop by providing SQL-like syntax, supporting complex data types, and optimizing performance through distributed processing.



### Summary

This text provides an overview of different join operations, file formats, and data management techniques in Hive and Hadoop, focusing on optimizing data processing, storage, and retrieval.

2. **Full Outer Join**: Returns all records from both tables, using NULL for non-matching keys.

3. **Left Semi Join**: Used in place of `IN EXISTS` to filter rows in one table based on another.

4. **Map Side Join**: Optimizes join queries by loading smaller tables into memory, reducing memory allocation and steps involved. Deprecated hints like `MAPJOIN` have been replaced by `hive.auto.convert.join`.

5. **Union All**: Combines sub-queries with the same column structure, simplifying complex queries.

#### File Formats in Hadoop

1. **Columnar Format**: Stores data in columns rather than rows, optimizing I/O by retrieving only necessary columns. This format is ideal for analytic queries on large datasets due to its efficient storage and retrieval capabilities. It compresses similar data types together, enhancing storage optimization.

2. **Schema Evolution**: Allows for schema changes over time, supporting backward compatibility. This is crucial when dealing with large datasets where rewriting data with a new schema is costly.

3. **Splittable Formats**: Critical for performance in Hadoop, enabling data to be processed in parallel. Non-splittable formats like JSON and XML can impact performance negatively.

4. **Compression**: Essential for optimizing storage and I/O bandwidth. Hadoop supports various compression formats like gzip, bzip2, lzo, and snappy, each with different properties regarding speed, CPU usage, and splittability.

#### Specific File Formats

1. **Text**: Simple and lightweight but slow for read/write operations. Supports file-level compression.

2. **Sequence Files**: Address the small file problem by combining them into larger files for efficient HDFS storage. They support block and record-level compression.

3. **Avro**: Offers language-neutral data serialization, supporting schema evolution and cross-language interoperability. It uses JSON for schema definition and is efficient for dynamic schema reconciliation.

### Key Concepts

- **Optimized Read and Compression**: Columnar formats enhance read efficiency and storage through compression, especially beneficial for analytic queries.

# Summary of Hadoop and Data Compression Techniques

## Overview of Hadoop Compression

In Hadoop, data compression plays a crucial role in optimizing storage and improving performance. When data is processed through MapReduce, it is automatically decompressed. Compression can be categorized into intermediate and output compression, both of which help in reducing storage requirements and enhancing I/O performance. Splittable compression is particularly beneficial as it allows files to be divided into smaller chunks, enabling parallel processing and improving efficiency.

## Compression Codecs

Hadoop supports various compression codecs, each with distinct characteristics:

- **Gzip**: Offers a high compression ratio but is not splittable, making it less suitable for MapReduce tasks that require frequent access.
- **Bzip2**: Provides higher compression than Gzip and is splittable, though it is slower and more CPU-intensive.
- **LZO**: Balances compression ratio and speed, is splittable when indexed, and supports parallel processing.
- **Snappy**: Prioritizes speed over compression ratio, is inherently splittable, and is ideal for data requiring frequent access.

The choice of compression codec depends on the specific use case, balancing between speed and storage efficiency.

## Importance of Splittable Compression

Splittable compression formats are essential for large datasets. They allow Hadoop to process data in parallel by dividing it into blocks, which can be executed independently. Non-splittable formats, like Gzip, require the entire file to be processed as a single task, which can degrade performance and increase memory usage.

## Choosing the Right Compression Approach

Selecting an appropriate compression technique involves considering factors such as CPU capacity, I/O, and network bandwidth. Bzip2 is suitable for archival data due to its high compression ratio, despite being slow. Snappy is preferred for fast processing with moderate compression. LZO offers a middle ground, with moderate compression and speed.

## Hadoop Components and Features

Hadoop's architecture includes components like HDFS, which stores data across distributed nodes, and YARN, which manages resources and scheduling. HDFS ensures data reliability through replication and supports various file formats like Avro and Parquet, which offer different benefits in terms of compression and processing efficiency.

## Conclusion

Effective data compression in Hadoop enhances performance and storage efficiency. By leveraging the right compression codecs and understanding their characteristics, organizations can optimize their big data processing workflows. Splittable compression formats are particularly advantageous for large-scale data processing, enabling better utilization of Hadoop's distributed architecture.
