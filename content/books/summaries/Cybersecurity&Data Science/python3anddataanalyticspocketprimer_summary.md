### Introduction to Python String Operations

Python provides straightforward methods for string manipulation, including extracting substrings, changing case, and formatting. Basic operations, such as slicing strings using array notation (start:stop:step), allow users to easily manipulate text. For instance, `x = "abcdef"` can be sliced as `x[0]` to get 'a' or `x[-1]` to get 'f'. However, operations like subtracting strings (`'a' - 'b'`) will result in a `TypeError`.

### String Comparison and Formatting

Python's `lower()` and `upper()` methods help in case-insensitive string comparison. Example code in `Compare.py` demonstrates how these methods facilitate comparisons. For formatting, Python offers functions like `ljust()`, `rjust()`, and `center()` to align text, as well as the `format()` method for advanced string interpolation.

### Handling None and Uninitialized Variables

Python differentiates between uninitialized variables and those set to `None`, which signifies "no value." This distinction is crucial for conditional logic and error handling.

### String Slicing and Splicing

Python's slicing allows for flexible text manipulation. Using negative indices, such as `text1[-1]`, retrieves characters from the end of a string. The language also supports inserting strings into other strings, enhancing text processing capabilities.

### Character Testing with Regular Expressions

Python can determine if strings contain digits or alphabetic characters using functions like `isdigit()` and `isalpha()`. The `CharTypes.py` script illustrates these checks, showing how to identify and categorize string content.

### Searching and Replacing Strings

The `find()` method helps locate substrings within a string, returning the index of the first occurrence or `-1` if not found. The `replace()` function substitutes parts of a string, as demonstrated in `Replace1.py`, where "is a" is replaced with "was a."

### Removing Whitespace

Python's `strip()`, `lstrip()`, and `rstrip()` functions remove leading and trailing whitespace. For internal spaces, the `replace()` function or regular expressions can be used to clean up text efficiently.

### Printing Without New Lines

To suppress newline characters in print statements, Python allows string concatenation or the use of `sys.stdout.write()`. This is useful for creating continuous text output.

### Text Alignment and Formatting

Text alignment can be achieved with methods like `ljust()`, `rjust()`, and `center()`. The `format()` function offers additional control over text justification using `<`, `>`, or `^` for left, right, and center alignment, respectively.

### Date and Time Functions

Python's `datetime` module provides comprehensive date and time manipulation capabilities. Functions allow fetching the current date and time, formatting dates, and performing arithmetic operations on date objects.

### Exception Handling

Python uses try/except blocks to manage exceptions, providing a robust way to handle errors like incompatible type operations. Custom exceptions can be defined for more specific error handling.

Documentation is available at [texthero.org/docs/getting-started](https://texthero.org/docs/getting-started).

## Introduction to Pandas

Pandas is introduced for creating labeled dataframes and displaying metadata. Users learn to create dataframes from random numbers, hard-coded data, Excel spreadsheets, and CSV files. Operations such as numeric calculations (minimum, mean, maximum) and scatterplot generation are covered. JSON data conversion is also discussed.

## Probability and Statistics

### Probability

Probability involves calculating the likelihood of an event. It is defined as the number of times an outcome occurs divided by the total number of outcomes, e.g., the probability of tossing heads or tails with a balanced coin is 1/2. Conditional probability examines the likelihood of event E1 given E2 has occurred.

### Expected Value

Expected value is calculated by multiplying each outcome by its probability and summing the results. For example, with a coin toss where heads yield $1 and tails $0, the expected value after 100 tosses is 50.

### Random Variables

Random variables can be discrete (finite/countably infinite values) or continuous (uncountably infinite values). Distributions like Gaussian, Poisson, Chi-squared, and Binomial are explored. Gaussian distributions are symmetric, while Poisson distributions are not.

### Statistical Concepts

#### Mean, Median, Mode

- **Mean**: The average of a set of numbers, sensitive to outliers.
- **Median**: The middle value in a sorted set, less sensitive to outliers.
- **Mode**: The most frequently occurring value, with bimodal and multimodal possibilities.

#### Variance and Standard Deviation

Variance measures the spread of numbers in a dataset. Standard deviation is the square root of variance. These metrics are sensitive to outliers.

#### Population and Sample

Population refers to the entire group being studied, while samples are subsets. Population variance is adjusted by multiplying the sample variance by n/(n-1).

### Key Statistical Terms

### Summary

**Chebyshev’s Inequality**  
Chebyshev's inequality states that at least 75% of data lies within two standard deviations of the mean. This is a mathematically proven result.

**P-Value**  
A p-value assesses the null hypothesis, indicating no correlation between variables. A small p-value (<0.005) suggests rejecting the null hypothesis. Typically, thresholds are set at 1% or 5%.

**Moments of a Function**  
Moments provide information about a function's shape. The first four moments are:
- Mean (1st moment)
- Variance (2nd moment)
- Skewness (3rd moment)
- Kurtosis (4th moment)

**Skewness**  
Measures asymmetry of a distribution. Left skew: mean < median < mode; right skew: mode < median < mean. Transformations like exponential, log, or power can normalize skewed data.

**Kurtosis**  
Assesses the "tailedness" of a distribution. It's the scaled fourth moment. Types include mesokurtic, leptokurtic, and platykurtic.

**Data and Statistics Concepts**

- **TSS (Total Sum of Squares):** Total variation in the dataset.
- **R²:** Proportion of variance explained by the model. Ranges from 0 to 1.
- **F1 Score:** Harmonic mean of precision and recall, useful for classification tasks.

**Gini Impurity and Entropy**  
- **Gini Impurity:** Measures the probability of incorrect classification. Ranges from 0 to 1.
- **Entropy:** Measures the average number of bits needed to encode outcomes. Calculated using logarithms.

**Perplexity**  
Related to entropy, perplexity measures how well a probability distribution predicts a sample. It is calculated using logarithms in a specified base.

**Cross-Entropy and KL Divergence**  
- **Cross-Entropy:** Used in machine learning to measure the difference between two probability distributions.
- **KL Divergence:** Measures how one probability distribution diverges from a second, expected probability distribution.

These concepts are central to understanding statistical analysis and machine learning, aiding in model evaluation and data interpretation.



## Introduction to Probability and Statistics

This text delves into key statistical concepts and their applications in data analytics and machine learning. It begins with an exploration of **entropy**, **cross-entropy**, and **KL divergence**. Entropy measures the randomness in a probability distribution, while cross-entropy compares two distributions, P and Q. KL divergence quantifies the difference between two probability distributions and is defined as the difference between cross-entropy and the entropy of P.

### KL and JS Divergence

KL divergence is essential in various algorithms like t-SNE for dimensionality reduction. JS divergence, a symmetric and true metric, is based on KL divergence and offers a balanced measure between two distributions.

### Covariance and Correlation Matrices

The text explains the covariance matrix, which is an nxn matrix showing variance on the diagonal and covariance between pairs of variables elsewhere. The covariance matrix is symmetric, meaning its transpose is identical. If variables are on different scales, a correlation matrix, which normalizes these values, is preferred. This matrix uses the formula: 

\[ \text{corr}(x,y) = \frac{\text{cov}(x,y)}{\text{std}_x \times \text{std}_y} \]

### Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors

Eigenvalues and eigenvectors are crucial in understanding the properties of matrices. For a symmetric real matrix, eigenvalues are real numbers, and eigenvectors are vectors in a Euclidean space. The eigenvectors are orthogonal, meaning their inner product is zero. The text provides an example of calculating eigenvalues and eigenvectors using a 2x2 matrix.

### Gauss-Jordan Elimination

This technique is used to solve systems of linear equations by transforming a matrix into its identity form. The process involves a series of arithmetic operations to achieve this transformation, demonstrating matrix inversion and solving linear equations.

### Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

PCA is a linear dimensionality reduction technique that identifies the most important features in a dataset. It is variance-based and creates orthogonal variables that are linear combinations of the original variables. PCA is especially useful for preprocessing before clustering and reducing computation time by focusing on key features. The PCA algorithm involves:

1. Calculating the correlation matrix.
2. Finding the eigenvalues and eigenvectors.
3. Constructing a new matrix from these eigenvectors.

PCA uses variance to prioritize components, with higher variance indicating greater importance. The process orders eigenvectors by their associated eigenvalues, allowing for efficient data visualization and model simplification.

# Summary of Regular Expressions in Python

## Introduction to Regular Expressions

Regular expressions (RE) are powerful tools for searching and manipulating text. The `re` module in Python provides Perl-style regular expression patterns for searching, replacing, and splitting text strings.

## Metacharacters

Python's metacharacters are similar to those in Perl and other languages. Key metacharacters include:
- `?`: Matches 0 or 1 occurrence.
- `*`: Matches 0 or more occurrences.
- `+`: Matches 1 or more occurrences.
- `^`: Anchors the expression to the start of a line or negates a character class.
- `$`: Anchors the expression to the end of a line.
- `.`: Matches any character except a newline.

To match metacharacters literally, use a backslash (`\`) to escape them, or enclose them in square brackets (`[]`).

## Character Classes

Character classes simplify pattern expressions:
- `\d`: Matches a digit (0-9).
- `\w`: Matches a word character (alphanumeric).
- `\s`: Matches whitespace.
- `\b`: Matches a word boundary.
- `\D`, `\W`, `\S`: Match non-digit, non-word, and non-whitespace characters, respectively.

Quantifiers like `{}` specify the number of occurrences:
- `[0-9]{3}`: Matches exactly 3 digits.
- `[a-z]{2,4}`: Matches 2 to 4 lowercase letters.

## Using the `re` Module

### Methods

- `match()`: Checks for a match at the start of a string.
- `search()`: Searches for a match anywhere in a string.
- `findall()`: Returns all matches as a list.
- `finditer()`: Returns all matches as an iterator.

### Example Usage

To remove metacharacters from a string:
python
import re
text = "meta characters ? and / and + and ."
cleaned = re.sub("[/\.*?=+]+", "", text)


### `re.match()` Method

The `re.match()` method checks for a match at the beginning of a string. It returns a match object on success. Use `group()` to access matched parts:
python
import re
pattern = re.compile('(a(b)c)de')
match = pattern.match('abcde')
match.group(0)  # Returns 'abcde'
match.group(1)  # Returns 'abc'
match.group(2)  # Returns 'b'


### `re.search()` Method

Unlike `match()`, `search()` checks for a match anywhere in the string:
python
import re
pattern = re.compile('abc')
search_result = pattern.search('123abc456')


## Options and Modifiers

Modifiers alter matching behavior:
- `re.I`: Case-insensitive matching.
- `re.M`: Multiline matching.
- `re.S`: Dot matches all characters, including newline.
- `re.U`: Unicode matching.

Experiment with these modifiers to see their effects on pattern matching.

## Conclusion

Understanding and using regular expressions in Python can greatly enhance text processing capabilities. The `re` module provides a robust set of tools for working with text patterns efficiently.



# Summary of Regular Expressions in Python

This document provides an overview of using regular expressions in Python, focusing on methods for matching, searching, and manipulating strings. Key functions and methods from the `re` module are demonstrated through examples.

## Search and Match Methods

- **`search()` vs. `match()`**: 
  - `search()` scans through a string for any location where the regex pattern matches, while `match()` checks for a match only at the beginning of the string.
  - Example: `re.search('this', 'this is the one')` returns a span of `(0, 4)`, while `re.match('the', 'this is the one')` raises an error as it doesn't match the start.

## Character Classes and `findall()`

- **Character Classes**: Used to define a set of characters to match.
  - Example: `re.findall("(\d+)", "123456")` finds all digit sequences, returning `['123456']`.
  - Matching individual characters: `re.findall("(\w)", "1a2b3c456")` results in `['1', 'a', '2', 'b', '3', 'c', '4', '5', '6']`.

## Finding Capitalized Words

- Example: `re.findall(r'[A-Z][\w\.-]+', "This Sentence contains Capitalized words")` finds capitalized words, returning `['This', 'Sentence', 'Capitalized']`.

## Additional Matching Functions

- **Methods on Match Objects**:
  - `group()`: Returns the matched string.
  - `start()`, `end()`, `span()`: Provide positional details of the match.
  - Example: Using `search()` and `group()` to extract parts of a sentence: `searchObj.group(1)` returns `Giraffes`.

## Grouping and Method Chaining

- **Grouping**: Parentheses in regex can group parts of patterns.
  - Example: `re.compile('(ab)*').match('ababababab').group()` returns `'ababababab'`.

## Using Delimiters and Splitting Strings

- **`split()` Method**: Splits strings based on a regex pattern.
  - Example: `re.split(r'[,:;\s]', "abc1,abc2:abc3;abc4 123 456")` results in `['abc1', 'abc2', 'abc3', 'abc4', '123', '456']`.

## Substitution with `sub()`

- **`sub()` Method**: Replaces matches with a specified string.
  - Example: `p.sub('some', 'one book two books three books')` results in `'some book some books some books'`.

## Matching Start and End of Strings

- **Functions `startswith()` and `endswith()`**: Used to check if a string starts or ends with certain patterns.
  - Example: `re.match("^[Tt]his", "This is a line")` checks if a line starts with 'This' or 'this'.

## Compilation Flags

- **Flags**: Modify regex behavior, such as case sensitivity with `IGNORECASE` or `I`.

## Compound Expressions

- Using the pipe `|` symbol allows combining multiple regex patterns.
  - Example: `re.match("^This|That", "That is a line")` matches lines starting with 'This' or 'That'.

## Counting Character Types

- Example: Counting digits, letters, and other characters in a string: `line1 = "A line with numbers: 12 345"` results in `charcount: 16, digitcount: 5, othercount: 6`.

This document provides foundational knowledge for utilizing regular expressions in Python, enabling efficient text processing and manipulation.
