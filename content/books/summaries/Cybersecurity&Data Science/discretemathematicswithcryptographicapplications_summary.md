### Summary

The text explores fundamental concepts in mathematics, focusing on natural numbers, integers, and their properties. It begins by defining basic arithmetic operations: multiplication, division, and the roles of factors, divisors, dividends, and quotients. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 with only two positive divisors, 1 and itself. Numbers that are not prime are called composite, and the number 1 is neither prime nor composite.

The text also discusses the classification of integers based on parity, dividing them into even and odd numbers. A proof is provided to establish that 2 is the only even prime number using a method called Proof by Contradiction, which is a logical technique used to demonstrate the truth of a statement by assuming the opposite and arriving at a contradiction.

The Principle of Mathematical Induction is introduced as a crucial method for proving statements about natural numbers. This principle involves two steps: verifying a base case and proving that if a statement holds for an arbitrary case, it holds for the next. This method is widely used in mathematics to establish the validity of statements involving infinite sets.

Several problems are presented to illustrate these concepts. For example, the sum of consecutive odd numbers is shown to be a perfect square using induction. Another problem demonstrates that a specific large integer plus 2991 is a perfect square, highlighting the limitations of incomplete induction.

The text concludes with a discussion on quadratic polynomials, providing an example where a polynomial evaluated at different integers yields prime numbers, except for a specific case where it results in a composite number. This example underscores the intricacies involved in number theory and the importance of thorough proof methods.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of logical reasoning and proof techniques in mathematics, particularly when dealing with infinite sets and establishing the properties of numbers. It highlights the necessity of rigorous proofs, especially in the context of delegating proofs to computers, and the enduring significance of mathematical induction as a foundational tool in the discipline.



The text explores various mathematical concepts, focusing on the principles of mathematical induction, factorials, recursive definitions, and elementary functions. 

### Mathematical Induction

### Summary

Mathematics often develops models to represent various phenomena, such as calculating the cost of carpeting a room. Similarly, a mathematical model for human language was developed by George Boole, known as the Algebra of Logic or propositional algebra. This model, initially thought useful only for puzzles, is now integral to computer logic.

**Propositions and Logic:**
Mathematical logic involves constructing arguments using formal methods, aiming to model human language. In this context, propositions are declarative sentences that can be either true or false, represented by symbols like \( p, q, r, \) etc. Truth values are denoted as \( T \) (True) or \( F \) (False), with numeric equivalents 1 and 0, respectively.

**Simple and Compound Propositions:**
Propositions are either simple or compound. Simple propositions lack internal structure, focusing solely on truth value. Compound propositions are formed by combining simple ones using logical connectives like AND, OR, NOT, and IF...THEN. The meaning of words is secondary to their truth values.

**Logical Equivalence:**
Two propositions are logically equivalent if they have the same truth value across all possible scenarios. This is denoted by \( A \equiv B \). Logical equivalence is crucial in mathematical logic, akin to identities in algebra.

**Truth Tables:**
Truth tables represent propositions and Boolean functions, showing how truth values of components affect the overall proposition. For instance, a truth table for a proposition with two variables will have four rows, each representing different combinations of truth values.

**Connectives:**
Logical operations or connectives combine propositions into new ones, forming compound propositions. Common connectives include:
- **Negation (¬):** Inverts the truth value.
- **Conjunction (AND, ∧):** True if both propositions are true.
- **Disjunction (OR, ∨):** True if at least one proposition is true.
- **Conditional (IF...THEN, →):** False only if the first proposition is true and the second is false.

**Logical Functions:**
Propositions can be viewed as logical expressions or functions. Unlike calculus functions, logical functions are simple, with a domain of two values (1 for true, 0 for false). Logical functions are often expressed in standard function notation, such as \( A(p, q) \).

**Syntax and Validity:**
The syntax of propositional algebra must be precise, similar to programming languages. Valid strings or sequences of symbols are essential for constructing logical expressions. Tuples, or ordered lists of symbols, are used to represent combinations of truth values.

**Principle of Substitution:**
This principle allows the substitution of equivalent propositions within logical expressions, ensuring that the overall truth value remains unchanged.

In conclusion, propositional algebra is a foundational aspect of mathematical logic, providing a structured way to model reasoning and argumentation. Its principles are widely applied in computer science and other fields, emphasizing the importance of clarity and precision in logical expressions.



# Summary of Logical Propositions and Boolean Functions

This text explores the mathematical foundation of logical propositions and Boolean functions, focusing on their structure, operations, and applications. It begins by highlighting the use of separators like parentheses and brackets in logical formulas, which can complicate readability for humans. To address this, the text introduces logical operators and rules of preference to create unique formulas without excessive symbols.

## Propositions as Boolean Functions

Propositions are treated as algebraic objects subject to operations like negation and conjunction, without discussing their meanings. These propositions, or Boolean functions, consist of variables that can independently take two values: True (T) or False (F). For two variables, p and q, four pairs of argument values are possible: (TT), (TF), (FT), and (FF). This results in 16 non-equivalent binary propositions, each represented by a truth table.

## Truth Tables and Logical Connectives

The text provides a detailed examination of truth tables for binary propositions with two arguments. It identifies familiar propositions, such as logical constants (0 and 1), negations, and coordinate functions. Some functions depend on only one argument, making others non-essential. Key logical connectives include:

- **Conjunction (AND)**: True only when both arguments are true.
- **Disjunction (OR)**: True when at least one argument is true.
- **NOR and NAND**: Used in switching circuits.
- **Exclusive Disjunction (XOR)**: True when exactly one argument is true.

## Properties of Logical Connectives

Logical connectives have properties like commutativity, associativity, and distributive laws. For example, conjunction and disjunction are commutative and associative. The text provides exercises to prove these properties using truth tables.

## Conditional Statements

Conditionals, or implications, are logical functions with two operands. The premise (p) and conclusion (q) determine the truth value of the conditional. The text explains that if the premise is true and the conclusion false, the conditional is false. Otherwise, it is true. Variations like converse, inverse, and contrapositive are also discussed.

## Tautologies and Logical Reasoning

Tautologies are identically true formulas representing logical reasoning rules, such as syllogism and modus ponens. These tautologies are crucial for reasoning and are always correct, irrespective of the topic. The text concludes with exercises to prove various tautologies and calculate truth values of given expressions.

In summary, the text provides a comprehensive overview of logical propositions and Boolean functions, emphasizing their algebraic treatment, truth tables, and logical connectives. It also explores conditional statements and the significance of tautologies in logical reasoning.

The emphasis on proofs, logical identities, and operations underscores their importance in developing rigorous logical arguments and solving complex problems.



In formal theories, the distinction between propositions and propositional forms is crucial. A proposition becomes defined when a value is assigned to a variable, such as x = 3 in the equation x + 3 = 3, which results in a false proposition. Propositional forms and propositions together are known as formulas, while terms consist of names and name forms. These elements form the foundation of any formal theory.

Formal theories typically include four components: primary concepts, definitions, axioms, and statements like lemmas and theorems. Primary concepts, such as classes and propositions, are undefined and form the basis for introducing definitions and axioms. Axioms are accepted without proof and serve as the foundation for proving theorems. Theorems explore logical consequences and applications of the theory's assumptions.

A class, a primary concept, is a collection of objects with specified properties, but its definition can lead to paradoxes, such as Russell’s paradox. This paradox arises from self-reference, like the Liar Paradox, and demonstrates the need for careful handling of classes to avoid contradictions. To maintain consistency, mathematics distinguishes between classes as primary entities and sets as secondary defined objects, focusing on finite and countable sets to avoid self-referencing issues.

Set theory involves representing sets through various methods, such as list or roster notation and set-builder notation. Sets are collections of elements, and their cardinality is the number of elements they contain. Finite sets have a definite number of elements, while infinite sets, like the set of natural numbers, continue indefinitely. The empty set, denoted as ∅, contains no elements and is a subset of every set.

Subsets are defined by the inclusion of all elements of one set within another. Two sets are equal if they contain the same elements. This equality is fundamental in mathematical proofs, often involving demonstrating the identity of two seemingly different sets. Examples include proving divisibility properties or theorems like Fermat’s Last Theorem and Goldbach’s conjecture.

The text also discusses the representation of sets using standard notations for various number sets, such as natural numbers (ℕ), whole numbers (ℕ₀), integers (ℤ), prime numbers (ℙ), rational numbers (ℚ), real numbers (ℝ), and complex numbers (ℂ). These notations help in defining and working with sets in mathematical contexts.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of understanding the foundational elements of formal theories and set theory, the careful handling of classes and sets to avoid paradoxes, and the role of axioms and theorems in developing consistent mathematical frameworks.



The text explores foundational concepts in set theory, focusing on the properties and operations of sets, and their implications in mathematical proofs and problem-solving. It begins by discussing the divisibility properties of integers, specifically examining the intersection of sets \( Z_2 \) and \( Z_3 \), demonstrating that any integer \( x \) in \( Z_6 \) is also in the intersection \( Z_2 \cap Z_3 \). This is proven by showing that \( x \) can be expressed as a multiple of both 2 and 3, hence a multiple of 6.

The text also discusses criteria for divisibility in integers, such as divisibility by 15, which requires divisibility by both 3 and 5 due to their coprimality. Similarly, it outlines a divisibility test for 8, which states that a number is divisible by 8 if it is even and divisible by 4.

The concept of a universal set, denoted as \( U \), is introduced as the overarching set containing all relevant elements for a given problem. This concept is crucial for understanding set operations like union, intersection, and complement. The Boolean algebra of sets is explained, where the collection of all subsets of a set \( A \) is denoted by \( P(A) \) or \( 2^A \).

Several set operations are defined: the complement of a set \( A \) within a universal set \( U \), the set difference \( A \setminus B \), the intersection \( A \cap B \), and the union \( A \cup B \). These operations are explored through examples, showing their properties such as commutativity and associativity.

The text further delves into set-theory identities and laws, such as De Morgan's Laws, which relate the union and intersection of sets through complements. It also covers the transitive property of set inclusion and provides exercises to reinforce these concepts.

Visual tools like Euler-Venn diagrams are suggested for illustrating set relationships, although the text emphasizes that diagrams are not substitutes for formal proofs. The text concludes with a discussion on digitizing set descriptions for computational purposes, using binary strings to represent sets within a fixed universe.

Overall, the text serves as a comprehensive guide to understanding set theory's role in discrete mathematics, highlighting its application in proofs, problem-solving, and computer science.



In this chapter, we explore fundamental mathematical structures frequently encountered in cryptography, such as groups, rings, and fields. These structures, though appearing different, share common properties, making their study essential for various applications.

**Groups** are sets with a defined operation that combines any two elements to form a third element, adhering to properties like associativity, the existence of a neutral element, and inverses. If the operation is commutative, the group is termed Abelian. For instance, integers form a commutative group under addition, with 0 as the neutral element.

**Rings** extend groups by including two operations: addition and multiplication. A ring is a non-empty set with operations that satisfy specific axioms, such as associativity and distributivity. Rings may not have division, distinguishing them from fields. A ring is commutative if its multiplication is commutative.

**Fields** are a type of ring where every non-zero element has a multiplicative inverse, allowing division. The set of real numbers forms an ordered field, meaning it supports a strict order relation. Complex numbers, however, do not form an ordered field due to the lack of comparability.

**Matrices** are introduced as rectangular arrays of numbers or functions. Operations on matrices include addition, subtraction, and multiplication. Matrix multiplication is not commutative, meaning the order of multiplication affects the result. The determinant of a matrix is a scalar value that can be computed recursively using the Laplace expansion. Determinants are crucial for understanding matrix properties, including invertibility.

The chapter also covers the concept of power sets and their ring structure, emphasizing how operations can be defined coordinate-wise. The Cartesian product of rings introduces a ring structure on n-tuples, allowing for complex algebraic manipulations.

Overall, the chapter highlights the interconnectedness of these algebraic structures and their relevance to cryptographic applications, providing a foundation for solving equations and understanding complex systems.



### Summary of Key Concepts in Linear Algebra and Group Theory

#### Theorems and Definitions

- **Theorem 7**: For square matrices \( A \) and \( B \) of the same size, the determinant of their product is the product of their determinants: \( \det(AB) = \det(A) \cdot \det(B) \).

- **Singular and Non-Singular Matrices**: A square matrix with a zero determinant is called singular; otherwise, it is non-singular.

- **Inverse Matrix**: A matrix \( B \) is the inverse of \( A \) (denoted \( A^{-1} \)) if \( A \cdot A^{-1} = I \), where \( I \) is the identity matrix. If \( A \) is invertible, \( A^{-1} \) is also invertible.

- **Symmetric Matrix**: A square matrix \( A = (a_{i,j}) \) is symmetric if \( a_{i,j} = a_{j,i} \) for all indices.

- **Symmetric Group \( S_d \)**: This is a group of all permutations of a set of \( d \) elements, with the group operation being the composition of permutations.

- **Cyclic Groups**: A group is cyclic if it can be generated by a single element, known as a generator. The order of the group is the number of elements it contains.

- **Commutative Group**: The set \( \mathbb{Z}_d^* \) of integers coprime with \( d \) forms a commutative group under multiplication modulo \( d \).

#### Important Problems and Examples

- **Discrete Logarithm Problem (DLP)**: Given a cyclic group \( \mathbb{Z}_p^* \) with a generator \( g \), find \( x \) such that \( g^x \equiv h \pmod{p} \). This problem is significant in cryptography due to its computational difficulty.

- **Problem Examples**:
  - Prove properties of non-commutative groups.
  - Explore orders of elements in cyclic groups.
  - Solve the discrete logarithm for given values.

#### Predicates and Quantifiers

- **Predicates**: A predicate is a function that returns true or false. Unary predicates depend on one variable, while n-ary predicates depend on multiple variables.

- **Quantifiers**:
  - **Existential Quantifier (\(\exists\))**: Indicates the existence of an element that satisfies a predicate.
  - **Universal Quantifier (\(\forall\))**: States that all elements satisfy a predicate.

- **Examples**:
  - The statement "There exists an integer divisor of 25" is true.
  - The statement "Every integer divides 25" is false.

These concepts form the foundation for understanding more complex structures in algebra and their applications in fields like cryptography.



### Summary

The text discusses the concepts of predicates and quantifiers in mathematical logic, focusing on their properties and applications. It begins by explaining the distinction between free and bounded variables in predicates. A free variable in an n-ary predicate becomes bounded when a quantifier is applied, reducing the predicate's arity by one.

#### Key Concepts

1. **Truth Values of Propositions**: 
   - The existential quantifier (∃) can make a proposition true if there exists at least one instance where the predicate holds.
   - The universal quantifier (∀) requires that the predicate holds for all instances, which can make a proposition false if there is at least one counterexample.

2. **Examples and Solutions**:
   - Example 15 illustrates bounding a variable with an existential quantifier, showing how it affects truth values when applied to a predicate.
   - Example 16 applies the existential quantifier to a binary predicate, demonstrating the truth domain concept.

3. **Predicate Properties**:
   - A predicate is satisfiable if it is not identically false.
   - Identically true predicates have their truth domain equal to the entire domain, while identically false predicates have an empty truth domain.

4. **Boolean Operations and Quantifiers**:
   - Boolean operations like conjunction (∧) and disjunction (∨) do not always commute, similar to arithmetic operations.
   - The order of operations and the use of separators like parentheses are crucial for clarity.

5. **De Morgan’s Laws**:
   - Generalized De Morgan laws for predicates are introduced, illustrating the equivalence between negations and quantifiers.

6. **Commutativity and Quantifiers**:
   - The commutativity of quantifiers is explored, showing that for predicates with finite domains, universal quantifiers resemble conjunctions, and existential quantifiers resemble disjunctions.

7. **Theorems and Proofs**:
   - Theorems 11 and 12 establish relationships between quantifiers and Boolean operations, proving identities and conditionals for predicates with finite domains.
   - Theorem 13 discusses the commutativity of multiple quantifiers and provides examples to illustrate these concepts.

8. **Applications and Examples**:
   - Examples from calculus demonstrate the application of these logical principles, such as the distinction between continuous and uniformly continuous functions, based on the order of quantifiers.

#### Practical Implications

Understanding the interplay between quantifiers and predicates is essential in mathematical logic, as it influences the truth values of propositions. The text emphasizes the importance of the order of operations and the role of quantifiers in defining logical statements. These principles have applications in various fields, including mathematics, computer science, and beyond.

By mastering these concepts, one can effectively analyze and construct logical arguments, ensuring clarity and precision in mathematical reasoning.



### Summary

This text explores concepts from discrete mathematics, focusing on predicates, quantifiers, binary relations, and Cartesian products, with applications in cryptography.

#### Predicates and Quantifiers

The text begins by discussing predicates, which are statements that can be true or false depending on the values of their variables. Quantifiers, such as "for all" (∀) and "there exists" (∃), are used to express logical statements involving these predicates. The text provides examples of how quantifiers can be defined using finite conjunctions or disjunctions, highlighting the complexity of predicate logic.

Key equivalences in predicate logic are also discussed, such as:
1. Double negation: \( \neg\neg P \equiv P \)
2. Idempotent laws: \( P \lor P \equiv P \) and \( P \land P \equiv P \)
3. Absorption laws: \( P \lor (P \land Q) \equiv P \)

#### Cartesian Products and Ordered Totalities

The text defines Cartesian products as sets of ordered pairs formed from two sets. For example, the Cartesian product \( X \times Y \) consists of all pairs \( (x, y) \) where \( x \in X \) and \( y \in Y \). It emphasizes the distinction between ordered pairs and sets, noting that \( (a, b) \neq (b, a) \) unless \( a = b \).

The concept of ordered n-tuples is introduced, extending Cartesian products to multiple sets. These structures are crucial for defining relational databases and understanding binary relations.

#### Binary Relations

Binary relations are subsets of Cartesian products representing relationships between elements of two sets. For instance, a relation from set \( A \) to set \( B \) is a subset of \( A \times B \). The text explains how binary relations can be composed and inverted, providing a foundation for more complex relational structures.

Examples illustrate binary relations, such as a manager's relationship with employees, represented by pairs like \( (X, A) \), \( (X, B) \), and \( (X, C) \). The text also discusses n-ary relations, which extend this concept to multiple sets.

#### Functions as Special Relations

Functions are defined as special types of binary relations where each element in the domain is related to exactly one element in the codomain. This definition aligns with the traditional view of functions in mathematics.

#### Applications and Exercises

The text includes exercises to reinforce understanding, such as proving properties of truth domains and exploring the commutativity of Cartesian products. These exercises encourage the application of theoretical concepts to practical problems.

Overall, the text serves as a comprehensive introduction to fundamental concepts in discrete mathematics, emphasizing their importance in logical reasoning and relational database design.



# Summary of Binary Relations and Orderings

## Binary Relations

Binary relations are fundamental in mathematics and computer science, particularly within relational databases. A binary relation on a set \(X\) involves pairs \((a, b)\) from \(X \times X\). Key properties of binary relations include:

- **Reflexivity**: A relation is reflexive if every element is related to itself, i.e., \((x, x) \in r\) for all \(x \in X\).
- **Symmetry**: A relation is symmetric if \((x, y) \in r\) implies \((y, x) \in r\).
- **Antisymmetry**: A relation is antisymmetric if \((x, y) \in r\) and \((y, x) \in r\) imply \(x = y\).
- **Transitivity**: A relation is transitive if \((a, b) \in r\) and \((b, c) \in r\) imply \((a, c) \in r\).

### Examples:
- The equality relation \(=\) is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive.
- The relation \(\leq\) is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive.
- The relation \(<\) is irreflexive and transitive.

## Orderings and Posets

A **partial order** is a binary relation that is reflexive, antisymmetric, and transitive. A set equipped with a partial order is called a **partially ordered set (poset)**. In a poset, not every pair of elements is necessarily comparable.

- **Linear Order**: A partial order where every pair of elements is comparable.
- **Well-Ordered Set**: A poset where every non-empty subset has a least element.

### Minimal and Maximal Elements:
- A **minimal element** has no other element less than it.
- A **least element** is less than or equal to every element in the subset.
- A **maximal element** has no other element greater than it.
- A **greatest element** is greater than or equal to every element in the subset.

## Equivalence Relations

An **equivalence relation** is a binary relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive. It partitions a set into equivalence classes where elements are equivalent to each other.

### Example:
- Congruence modulo a number is an equivalence relation.

## Problems and Proofs

### Summary of Equivalence Classes and Relational Databases

**Equivalence Classes:**

The concept of equivalence classes is fundamental in discrete mathematics. When considering integers modulo 3, equivalence classes can be formed. For instance, numbers equivalent to 1 mod 3 form an arithmetic sequence: \( K_1 = \{-5, -2, 1, 4, 7, \ldots\} \). Similarly, other sequences like \( K_2 = \{-7, -4, -1, 2, 5, 8, \ldots\} \) and \( K_3 = \{-6, -3, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, \ldots\} \) are formed. These sets are non-empty, mutually disjoint, and their union covers all integers, illustrating the partitioning of integers into equivalence classes.

An equivalence relation on a set \( X \) partitions the set into disjoint equivalence classes. Each class contains elements equivalent to a chosen element \( x \in X \). If all elements are equivalent to one another, the entire set forms a single equivalence class. Otherwise, each class is disjoint and their union is \( X \).

**Properties of Equivalence Relations:**

- **Lemma 4**: Two equivalence classes either coincide or are disjoint.
- **Theorem 14**: Equivalence classes are non-empty, disjoint sets whose union is the entire set \( X \).
- **Remark 5**: Constructing equivalence classes in infinite sets may require the axiom of choice.

Equivalence classes simplify problems by reducing infinite sets to finite factor-sets, like choosing representatives \( \{0, 1, 2\} \) for modulo 3 equivalence classes.

**Relational Databases:**

Relational databases store data in a structured format using tables, which are n-ary relations. Each table consists of entities (rows) and attributes (columns). For example, a student database might have attributes such as Student's Name, ID, Final Grade, and GPA.

A database is essentially a set of tuples from the Cartesian product of domains corresponding to attributes. The relational model allows efficient data retrieval and manipulation.

**Adjacency Matrix:**

An adjacency matrix represents binary relations in computer memory. For a relation \( r \) on a set \(\{a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n\}\), the matrix element \( m_{ij} = 1 \) if the relation holds between \( a_i \) and \( a_j \), and 0 otherwise. The properties of relations (e.g., reflexivity, symmetry) can be expressed using this matrix.

**Key Concepts:**

- **Equivalence Relation**: A relation that is reflexive, symmetric, and transitive, partitioning a set into equivalence classes.
- **Factor-Set**: The set of all equivalence classes of a set under an equivalence relation.
- **Partition**: A division of a set into disjoint subsets whose union is the entire set.
- **Relational Database**: A database structured to recognize relations among stored items of information.

Understanding these concepts allows for efficient data handling, simplification of mathematical problems, and effective database management.

- **Problem 255** explores properties of natural numbers under modulo \( n \), such as if \( a \cdot b \equiv 0 \pmod{n} \), then either \( a \equiv 0 \) or \( b \equiv 0 \).

- **Problem 256** presents solving congruences for \( x \), specifically \( 8x \equiv 1 \pmod{13} \), using Diophantine equations. Since 8 and 13 are coprime, the Euclidean algorithm provides solutions like \( x = 5 \).

#### Modular Arithmetic Properties

The text explains how coefficients in congruence equations can be reduced modulo \( d \) to a set \(\{0, 1, \ldots, d-1\}\). It highlights the transitive nature of congruences, proving that if \( k \equiv l \pmod{d} \) and \( l \equiv m \pmod{d} \), then \( k \equiv m \pmod{d} \).

#### Algebraic Structures

This summary encapsulates the essential concepts and problems of modular arithmetic, providing a concise overview of its principles, applications, and problem-solving strategies.



The text delves into key concepts in number theory, particularly focusing on modular arithmetic, Fermat's Little Theorem, and the Euler totient function, with applications in solving congruences and generating pseudorandom numbers. It also explores the Chinese Remainder Theorem (CRT) and its cryptographic applications.

### Modular Arithmetic and Fermat's Little Theorem

The text highlights the use of modular arithmetic to solve complex problems, exemplified by calculating large powers modulo a prime number using Fermat's Little Theorem. This theorem states that if \( p \) is a prime and \( a \) is an integer not divisible by \( p \), then \( a^{p-1} \equiv 1 \mod p \).

### Solving Linear Congruences

Linear congruences, akin to linear equations, are discussed with an algorithm for finding solutions. A key lemma states that a congruence \( ax \equiv b \mod m \) has a solution if and only if the greatest common divisor (gcd) of \( a \) and \( m \) divides \( b \). If it does, there are multiple solutions, otherwise, none.

### Euler's Totient Function

## Summary of Affine Ciphers and Boolean Functions

### Affine Ciphers

Affine ciphers are a type of substitution cipher that involve two integer parameters: dilation \( c \) and shift \( w \). The encryption function is defined using modular arithmetic, specifically modulo 26 for the English alphabet. The encryption formula is given by:

\[ f(n) = (cn + w) \mod 26 \]

To decrypt, the equation \( cw + n \equiv m \mod 26 \) must be solved for \( n \). This requires transposing \( w \) and multiplying by the modular inverse of \( c \), denoted as \( c^{-1} \). The inverse exists only if \( c \) and 26 are coprime. There are 12 possible values for \( c \) that satisfy this condition: \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25\}.

Affine ciphers have a significantly larger key space than shift ciphers, but they are still vulnerable to modern computational power. The key for an affine cipher is the ordered pair \( (c, w) \), and the total number of keys is the product of the number of possible values for \( c \) and 26.

### Boolean Functions

Boolean functions are mappings from a set of binary variables to a single binary outcome. An example of a Boolean function with three variables is:

\[ f(x_1, x_2, x_3) = (x_1 \land \lnot x_2) \lor x_3 \]

#### Normal Forms

- **Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF):** A Boolean function can be expressed as a disjunction of elementary conjunctions. A perfect DNF contains only complete elementary conjunctions (minterms).
  
- **Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF):** A Boolean function can also be expressed as a conjunction of elementary disjunctions. A perfect CNF contains only complete elementary disjunctions.

#### Truth Tables

Every Boolean function can be represented by a truth table, which lists all possible inputs and their corresponding outputs. The function can be constructed using the truth table by identifying rows that evaluate to true and forming a DNF from those rows.

#### Theorems

- A Boolean function is identically true if its CNF contains an elementary disjunction that is always true (contains both a variable and its negation).
- Conversely, a Boolean function is identically false if its DNF contains an elementary conjunction that is always false.

### Exercises and Problems

The text includes various exercises on number theory and Boolean algebra, such as finding the greatest common divisor (gcd), solving linear congruences, and computing modular inverses. These exercises reinforce the concepts of modular arithmetic and Boolean functions, providing practical applications in cryptography and discrete mathematics.

### Conclusion

Affine ciphers, while more complex than simple shift ciphers, are not secure against modern computational attacks. Boolean functions, fundamental in digital logic and computer science, can be represented and manipulated using normal forms and truth tables. Understanding these concepts is crucial for applications in cryptography and algorithm design.



### Summary of Boolean Functions and Cryptographic Concepts

#### Boolean Functions and Normal Forms

Boolean functions can be expressed as Disjunctive Normal Form (DNF) or Conjunctive Normal Form (CNF). A function is identically false if its DNF contains an indeterminate and its negation. Conversely, a CNF is identically true if all elementary disjunctions are true. Corollary 4 states that if a CNF (or DNF) of a Boolean function is identically true (or false), any other CNF (or DNF) has the same property.

#### Boolean Polynomials

Boolean functions can also be represented as logical polynomials, known as Zhegalkin polynomials. These are sums modulo 2 of logical monomials, which are conjunctions of variables without negations. Theorem 36 asserts that any Boolean function can be uniquely represented as a logical polynomial, up to the order of terms.

#### Boolean Derivatives

Boolean derivatives, or differences, are defined for Boolean functions over discrete sets. They have applications in error-correcting codes and cryptography. Key properties include the commutativity of derivatives with respect to different arguments and the sum rule for derivatives of sums.

#### Hashing Functions

Hashing functions compress data into a fixed-size hash or digest, crucial for efficient database management and cryptographic applications. They are not injective, leading to potential collisions. To resolve collisions, methods like linear probing are used. Hashing functions are integral in digital signatures and must be one-way to prevent reverse engineering.

#### Cryptography and Substitution Ciphers

Cryptography involves encrypting plaintext into ciphertext to protect information. Substitution ciphers replace each letter with another, based on a key. This method dates back to Julius Caesar. For secure encryption, the cipher must be a bijection to ensure unique decryption.

#### Example of Substitution Cipher

In a simplified alphabet example, substitution is used to encode messages. The key is a table mapping each character to another, ensuring bijection for successful decoding. This highlights the importance of bijective mappings in symmetric cryptosystems.

#### Practical Applications

Hashing functions and cryptography are vital in modern computing, from securing communications to managing large datasets. Understanding Boolean functions and their derivatives enhances the ability to design efficient algorithms for these purposes.




The text discusses cryptographic techniques and mathematical concepts, focusing on encoding and decoding messages using matrices and substitution ciphers. It begins by explaining the process of splitting a message into three-letter blocks and padding them if necessary. These blocks are then encoded using a non-singular 3x3 matrix, and the encoded message is represented as a string of numbers. To decode, the inverse of the matrix is used.

A bijective map, or one-way function, is introduced, which is computationally easy to perform but difficult to reverse, exemplified by prime factorization. The RSA algorithm relies on this principle. The text also touches on brute-force attacks, which involve trying all possible substitutions to decode a message. The vast number of permutations (26!) makes this method impractical for large datasets, highlighting the importance of efficient algorithms.

The Caesar cipher is described as a simple substitution code where each letter is shifted by a fixed number. This leads to the concept of modular arithmetic, where the alphabet wraps around after 'z'. The text suggests more complex ciphers by varying group sizes and using different matrices.

Generating functions (GFs) and generating polynomials (GPs) are introduced as methods to solve combinatorial problems, such as finding partitions and compositions of integers. These concepts are useful in various mathematical applications, including the inversion of sequences using binomial coefficients.

It introduces generating polynomials and inversion formulas, emphasizing the importance of linear operations over sequences and generating functions (GF). A key operation is the convolution of sequences, where the sequence 1 acts as the unit element. This establishes that sequences with addition, subtraction, scalar multiplication, and convolution form a unital commutative ring.

The text explores specific problems and exercises, such as proving identities and generating functions for partitions, and demonstrates the use of generating functions in mathematical proofs. It discusses Systems of Distinct Representatives (SDR) and provides examples, like committees formed by students, to illustrate the concept. The text references Hall's theorem, which provides conditions for the existence of an SDR, and Dilworth's theorem, which relates to the minimum number of chains in a poset.

Further, the text delves into block schemes and Balanced Incomplete Block Designs (BIBD), using examples like scheduling soccer tournaments and experiments with fertilizers to demonstrate the practical application of these concepts. It defines BIBD and highlights the parameters involved, such as the number of elements, blocks, and conditions for element pairings within blocks.

The text discusses several key concepts in Boolean functions and graph theory. It begins by addressing the duality principle in Boolean functions, stating that if a function \( F(x_1, \ldots, x_n) \) can be expressed as a composition of other functions, its dual can also be expressed similarly. The text explores the closure properties of linear Boolean functions, noting that the superposition of linear functions remains linear.

Lemmas are provided to demonstrate properties of non-self-dual and nonmonotone functions. For instance, a constant can be derived from a non-self-dual function, while a negation can be represented using a nonmonotone function. The text also discusses the construction of Boolean functions using vectors and logical operations.

The concept of precomplete classes of Boolean functions is introduced, highlighting five classes: \( T_0, T_1, S, M, \) and \( L \). Theorem 45 states that for a system of Boolean functions to be complete, it must not be entirely contained within any of these classes. The proof involves demonstrating that a complete system can generate all Boolean functions.

The text further elaborates on the sufficiency of a system by showing how negation and conjunction can be constructed from its functions. Theorem 46 states that a basis cannot exceed four Boolean functions, providing examples of such bases, including systems like \(\{ \neg, \land \}\).

In the section on graph theory, the text defines a geometric graph as a pair of sets \( V \) (vertices) and \( E \) (edges) with an incidence relation. Vertices are connected by edges, and the graph's order and size are determined by the number of vertices and edges, respectively. The degree of a vertex is the number of its incident edges, and various terms describe connections between vertices, such as paths and loops.

The text concludes with exercises to apply these concepts, such as determining the Post classes of Boolean functions, proving bases, and describing truth tables of self-dual functions. It emphasizes that proofs in the chapter are constructive, providing algorithms for substitutions to prove claims.

### Summary

The text explores various concepts in graph theory, focusing on Gray codes, Euler's formula, and planar graphs, with applications in cryptography and mathematics. 

**Gray Codes:**
Gray codes are a sequence of binary numbers where two consecutive numbers differ by only one bit. This concept is used to solve problems like the "Wallet problem," where one needs to determine the maximum amount that can be paid using a set of bills without exceeding a limit. The Gray code is not a programming code but an arrangement of Boolean words such that each word differs from its neighbor by a single bit. This method is useful in constructing truth tables for Boolean functions, ensuring minimal changes between consecutive entries.

**Wallet Problem:**
The Wallet problem is akin to the Knapsack problem, where the goal is to find the largest amount that can be spent given certain restrictions. Boolean vectors represent the denominations, and the problem can be solved using Gray codes to ensure the most efficient use of available bills.

**Euler’s Formula:**
Euler’s formula for polyhedrons states that for a connected planar graph, the relationship \( v + f - d = 2 \) holds, where \( v \) is the number of vertices, \( f \) is the number of faces, and \( d \) is the number of edges. This formula is significant in determining the planarity of graphs. A planar graph can be drawn on a plane without edges intersecting, which is crucial for applications like printed circuit design.

**Planar Graphs:**
A graph is planar if it can be embedded in a plane without edge intersections except at vertices. The text discusses the non-planarity of certain graphs like \( K_{3,3} \) and \( K_5 \), using Euler’s formula and other theorems to prove their properties. Planar graphs are essential in avoiding short circuits in electrical design.

**Bipartite Graphs:**
A bipartite graph is one where vertices can be divided into two disjoint sets with no edges within the same set. The complete bipartite graph \( K_{m,n} \) connects every vertex in one set to all vertices in the other. \( K_{3,3} \) is a classic example, often used in puzzles and problems related to graph planarity.

In summary, the text provides insights into graph theory's applications, emphasizing Gray codes, Euler's formula, and planar graphs. These concepts are crucial for solving complex mathematical problems and have practical applications in fields like cryptography and electrical engineering.



## Summary

### Bipartite Graphs and Cycles
A cycle in a bipartite graph contains an even number of edges. This property is fundamental in graph theory, especially when analyzing the structure and behavior of graphs.

### Planarity and Non-Planarity
The graph \( K_{3,3} \) is not planar, as demonstrated by the inequality \( 4f \leq 2d \), which contradicts the properties of planar graphs. Planarity can be determined by the absence of subgraphs derived from \( K_5 \) or \( K_{3,3} \).

### Graph Theory Problems
Several problems are presented to explore bipartite graphs, including proving properties and giving examples that challenge assumptions. For instance, determining when complete bipartite graphs \( K_{m,n} \) are trees.

### Exercises and Theorems
The text includes exercises on drawing graphs, proving properties, and exploring planar graphs. One exercise involves proving that a complete graph \( K_n \) has \( n(n-1)/2 \) edges.

### Trees and Forests
A tree is a connected acyclic graph, and a forest is a collection of trees. Theorem 50 outlines equivalent properties of trees, such as connectivity and the uniqueness of paths between vertices. A tree's size is \( |E| = p - 1 \), where \( p \) is the number of vertices.

### Spanning Trees
A spanning tree of a graph includes all its vertices and is a minimal connected subgraph. Kruskal's Algorithm is introduced for finding a minimum spanning tree in a weighted graph. It involves selecting edges with the smallest weights while avoiding cycles.

### Weighted Graphs
Weighted graphs assign weights to edges, which can represent various metrics like distance or cost. Finding a minimum spanning tree is crucial in applications where minimizing total weight is desired.

### Directed Graphs (Digraphs)
Digraphs differ from undirected graphs by having directed edges, akin to one-way streets. They are represented by a set of vertices and edges with an incidence function mapping edges to ordered vertex pairs.

### Problem Solving and Applications
The text discusses algorithms, such as Kruskal's, for practical applications in network design and optimization. It emphasizes the importance of understanding graph properties and algorithms in solving real-world problems.

### Conclusion
Graph theory provides a robust framework for analyzing and solving complex problems in various fields. Understanding the properties of different graph types and applying algorithms like Kruskal's are essential skills in discrete mathematics and related applications.

The text explores foundational concepts in computational theory, focusing on models like the Turing machine, Church-Turing thesis, and normal algorithms. These models, despite appearing different, are equivalent in describing computational processes. Researchers have developed other models, such as finite state machines and push-down automata, which are less powerful than Turing machines.

Finite automata, introduced by S. C. Kleene, are mathematical models for discrete processes, particularly used in electronic computers. They feature internal states and memory, distinguishing them from simpler models like combinatorial circuits. A finite automaton processes inputs through a defined sequence of states, generating outputs based on current and previous states.

A simple example of an automaton is described: a device that listens for a specific signal and triggers an alarm. This automaton uses a finite set of internal states and transitions between them based on input sequences. The automaton's behavior is formalized using sets and maps, which determine state transitions and outputs.

The text introduces the concept of a Mealy machine, a type of automaton defined by a quintuple of symbols representing input, output, states, and transition functions. These machines are deterministic, meaning their behavior is fully determined by their current state and input.

Tables and graphs are used to represent automata, illustrating state transitions and outputs. The text provides examples and problems to demonstrate how to construct and interpret these representations.

The classification of automata involves defining equivalent states and automata. Two states are equivalent if they produce the same outputs for any input sequence. Two automata are equivalent if each state in one has a corresponding equivalent state in the other.

The text also discusses the minimization of automata, aiming to reduce the number of states while maintaining equivalent behavior. This involves identifying and merging equivalent states using equivalence relations.

Overall, the text delves into computational models and automata theory, emphasizing the equivalence of different models and the practical aspects of designing and simplifying automata for computational tasks.



## Summary

### Automaton Minimization and Equivalence

The text discusses the minimization of finite automata, specifically focusing on the automaton 4𝑀. The process involves identifying equivalence classes among states based on their reactions to inputs, leading to a reduced automaton with fewer states but equivalent functionality. The minimization process is detailed through equivalence classes, where states are grouped based on their indistinguishable behavior under given inputs.

### Problem Solutions

- **Problem 442**: The automaton 4𝑀 is minimized by identifying 1-equivalence and 2-equivalence classes. States are grouped into classes 𝑆ₐ and 𝑆_b, with further subdivisions based on distinguishability.
- **Problem 443**: Outputs of automata 42(𝑠)𝑀 and 47(𝑠)𝑀 are determined for a specific input sequence.
- **Problem 444 & 445**: Tasks involve finding minimal forms of automata and constructing graphs for minimized automata.

### Automaton Operators

Automaton operators transform input words into output words, maintaining the length of the words (synchronous operators). A lexicographic operator is defined as causal if it satisfies specific conditions, and operators without anticipation are both synchronous and causal. The text introduces the concept of finite automaton operators, which are boundedly deterministic functions realized by finite automata.

### Theorem and Definitions

- **Theorem 56**: A lexicographic operator is an automaton operator if it is synchronous and causal (without anticipation).
- **Theorem 57**: A lexicographic operator is a finite automaton operator if it has finite weight and is without anticipation.

### Examples

- **Example 59 & 60**: Demonstrates operators without anticipation using binary alphabets. Operator T1 processes words with an even number of ones, while T2 processes based on the count of more ones than zeros.
- **Example 61**: Illustrates the conversion of an infinite tree into a finite graph for automaton T1.

### Regular Grammars

The text introduces regular grammars as an alternative approach to finite automata, focusing on Moore automata. Events over an alphabet are related to lexicographic operators, and a one-to-one correspondence exists between events and operators without anticipation. Automata represent events by outputting specific symbols based on input words, with the automaton's internal state determining the output.

### Key Concepts

- **Equivalence Classes**: States are grouped based on indistinguishable behavior under specific inputs.
- **Synchronous Operators**: Maintain input-output word length.
- **Causal Operators**: Satisfy specific conditions for input-output mapping.
- **Finite Automaton Operators**: Deterministic functions with finite realizability.
- **Regular Grammars**: Alternative representation of automata using events and vocabularies.

The text provides a comprehensive view of automaton minimization, operator definitions, and their applications, emphasizing clarity and logical structuring of automaton theory.



In the study of automata, events are represented by sets of words that transition the automaton into specific states. The goal is to establish criteria for the representability of events within an automaton. Events are defined as sets of words, with operations such as disjunction (union) and product (concatenation) applied to them. Events can be regular if they are derived using disjunction, concatenation, and iteration from elementary events over a given alphabet.

Kleene's Theorem states that an event is finitely automaton if it is regular up to the empty word. This theorem is proved using linear equations in the algebra of events. A unique solution exists for these equations, ensuring that if the events involved are regular, the solution remains regular up to the empty word.

The construction of an automaton involves creating a tree where each vertex corresponds to a residual operator generated by an input word. By trimming redundant branches, a finite graph is obtained, representing the automaton. This process ensures that the number of states corresponds to the number of residual operators, emphasizing the finite nature of the automaton.

Theorem 59, by V. Bodnarchuk, further explores systems of equations in the algebra of events. It states that such systems have unique solutions that are regular up to the empty word. The proof involves consecutive elimination and the use of basic operations to maintain regularity throughout iterations.

An algorithm by McNaughton-Yamada and Glushkov constructs finite automata from regular expressions. By numbering letters and marking initial letters, a graph is developed, which is then transformed into a deterministic finite automaton through a series of tables. This process identifies states representing the event and ensures the automaton's determinism.

The proof of Kleene's Theorem involves showing that states of an automaton represent an event if they can be expressed as a disjunction of regular events. The necessity and sufficiency of the theorem are demonstrated by constructing a finite automaton from a regular expression, thus proving that regular events can be accepted by finite automata.

In conclusion, the study of automata and event representation involves complex interactions between algebraic operations and the construction of finite state machines. Theorems and proofs within this field ensure that regular events can be effectively represented and accepted by finite automata, providing a robust framework for understanding computational processes.



## Summary

The text explores concepts in automata theory and game theory, focusing on non-regular events and zero-sum games. It begins by discussing a non-regular event, exemplified by a finite automaton that cannot represent an event where words contain equal amounts of symbols x and y. This is due to the need for infinitely many states to distinguish between different lengths of words composed of x, which contradicts the finite state requirement of regular languages as per Kleene's theorem.

The transition to game theory introduces its foundational aspects, highlighting its applications beyond entertainment, such as in operations research, decision-making, and military strategies. Game theory provides a mathematical framework for analyzing conflicts and cooperation among individuals or organizations. The text references seminal works by J. von Neumann and O. Morgenstern, noting the breadth of game theory's applications.

A classic example, "Tic-Tac-Toe," illustrates basic game theory concepts. Two players alternate placing symbols on a 3x3 grid, aiming to align three symbols in a row. The game is a zero-sum two-person game, where the sum of outcomes for both players is zero, indicating a draw if both play optimally. The text emphasizes the importance of strategies, defining pure strategies as predetermined plans based on available information, and mixed strategies as combinations of pure strategies with assigned probabilities.

The text introduces the concept of dominant and weakly dominant strategies, crucial for decision-making in games. A strategy is dominant if it results in better payoffs regardless of the opponent's strategy. The matrix form of games, a strategic representation, helps identify these strategies. Through examples, the text illustrates how players can use dominant strategies to simplify games by eliminating dominated strategies, aiming to reach equilibrium where each player's strategy is optimal given the other's choice.

The discussion extends to the classification of strategies and the role of dominance in simplifying decision-making processes. The text concludes by acknowledging the practical applications of game theory in real-life scenarios, such as driving conventions in different countries, and mentions typical games like "Matching Pennies" and "Prisoner's Dilemma" as models for various strategic situations.

Overall, the text provides a foundational understanding of automata and game theory, emphasizing the mathematical and strategic principles underlying these fields.




### Summary

The text explores two classic games in game theory: "Matching Pennies" and "Nim," and introduces concepts in information theory and coding.

#### Matching Pennies

"Matching Pennies" is a two-player zero-sum game involving players named Odd and Even. Each player flips a penny, revealing either Heads (H) or Tails (T). If both show the same side, Even wins both coins; if different, Odd wins. The game matrix shows possible outcomes, with no dominant strategy for either player due to symmetry. The optimal approach is random choice, demonstrating a Nash equilibrium where no player benefits from changing strategy.

#### Nim

The game of "Nim" involves two players and three heaps of items. Players take turns removing items from a heap, with the goal of taking the last item to win. The strategy involves binary representation of heap sizes and analyzing parity (odd or even vectors). If any vector is odd, the starting player has a winning strategy by making all vectors even. The example provided illustrates this with heaps of 11, 5, and 7 items. The key is converting heap counts to binary and strategically removing items to force the opponent into a losing position.

#### Information Theory and Coding

The chapter introduces information theory, focusing on the concept of information as sequences of binary words. Information must often be transmitted over long distances, necessitating coding into binary sequences. The text discusses the concept of a bit as a basic unit of information and the need for digitization in communication. The amount of information in a message is related to the number of possible outcomes, calculated using the binary logarithm. The formula for information quantity is \( I = \log_2(k) \), where \( k \) is the number of possible outcomes. The text also introduces the concept of probabilities in information theory, with the formula \( I = -\sum p_i \log_2(p_i) \) for average information content.

#### Example Problem

An example problem involves identifying a false coin from a set of 10 using a scale. The solution utilizes the information theory formula to determine the number of weighings needed, emphasizing the practical application of these concepts.

This summary captures the essence of the games and concepts discussed, highlighting strategies and the mathematical underpinnings of information theory.



The text delves into information theory and coding, focusing on the quantification of information, error detection, and correction in communication channels. It begins by discussing the concept of information measured in bits, using examples like finding a counterfeit coin among a set of coins. The amount of information gained from an experiment is calculated using logarithms, with specific examples provided.

The text introduces entropy as a measure of uncertainty in a random experiment, highlighting its significance in fields like cryptography. Claude Shannon's contributions to coding theory are noted, emphasizing the importance of understanding channels and their capacity to carry information. The text explains that no physical channel is noiseless, and noise can cause errors in transmitted signals. Error-detecting and correcting codes, such as those studied in algebraic coding theory, are crucial for maintaining data integrity.

The encoding process involves transforming a message into a code-word, which is a sequence of 0s and 1s. The text explains that redundancy in coding is necessary to detect and correct errors, as shown through examples of repetition codes. However, repetition codes can lead to increased transmission lengths, which may not be feasible in certain contexts, like space communications.

The Hamming distance is introduced as a metric to measure the difference between code-words, which helps in error detection and correction. The text provides examples and definitions related to encoding functions and their properties, such as the minimum distance between code-words, which determines the code's ability to detect and correct errors.

The text also includes exercises and problems to illustrate these concepts, such as determining the number of errors a code can detect or correct and constructing codes with specific error-detection capabilities. The importance of defining a sample space in probabilistic experiments is highlighted, using examples like coin flips and lotteries to demonstrate how different sample spaces can lead to different interpretations and solutions.

Overall, the text serves as a detailed exploration of information theory, focusing on the mathematical foundations of coding and the practical implications for error management in communication systems.



## Summary of Probability Theory Concepts

### Sample Space and Probability Distributions

A sample space is a collection of all possible outcomes in a probability experiment. For example, rolling three dice results in 216 ordered triples. Probability theory assigns a specific probability \( p(s) \) to each outcome \( s \) in the sample space \( S \). This set of probabilities forms a probability distribution, which must satisfy the following axioms:

- **PA1:** \( p(s) \geq 0 \) for any outcome \( s \).
- **PA2:** For any event \( E \) consisting of outcomes \( s_1, s_2, \ldots, s_k \), the probability \( p(E) = p(s_1) + p(s_2) + \ldots + p(s_k) \).
- **PA3:** The total probability \( p(S) = 1 \).

These axioms imply that the probability is finitely additive and that the empty event has zero probability.

### Experimental Probability

Experimental or frequency probability is derived from conducting experiments, such as tossing a coin multiple times. If an event \( E \) occurs \( k(E) \) times in \( n \) trials, the frequency probability is \( f(E) = \frac{k(E)}{n} \). As \( n \) increases, \( f(E) \) stabilizes to approximate the probability \( p(E) \).

### Equally Likely Probabilities

In theoretical studies, it is common to assume equally likely probabilities, where each outcome in the sample space \( S \) has the same probability. For example, in a fair coin toss, \( p(H) = p(T) = \frac{1}{2} \).

### Events and Operations

Events are subsets of the sample space, and operations on events include:

- **Complementary Events:** \( E \) and \( \bar{E} \) (the complement of \( E \)).
- **Disjoint Events:** Events with no common outcomes, \( p(E_1 \cap E_2) = 0 \).
- **Exhaustive Events:** A set of events that cover the entire sample space.

### Theorems and Principles

- **Theorem 61:**
  - For any event \( E \), \( p(\bar{E}) = 1 - p(E) \).
  - For any events \( E_1 \) and \( E_2 \), \( p(E_1 \cup E_2) = p(E_1) + p(E_2) - p(E_1 \cap E_2) \).

### Conditional Probability and Independence

Conditional probability \( p(E|C) \) is the probability of event \( E \) given that event \( C \) has occurred. Two events are independent if the occurrence of one does not affect the probability of the other, defined by \( p(E_1 \cap E_2) = p(E_1) \cdot p(E_2) \).

### Random Variables

A random variable is a real-valued function on a sample space that satisfies similar properties to probability distributions:

- **RA1:** \( f(s) \geq 0 \) for any \( s \).
- **RA2:** For any event \( E \), \( f(E) = \sum f(s_i) \).
- **RA3:** \( f(S) = 1 \).

### Problem Solving

Solving probabilistic problems often involves enumerative combinatorial problems, such as calculating permutations or combinations to determine probabilities.

### Example Problems

1. **Tetrahedron Toss:** Calculating probabilities for sums of numbers when two tetrahedra are tossed.
2. **Permutations:** Determining the probability of selecting a specific permutation of letters.
3. **Card Hands:** Finding probabilities for specific card combinations in a deck.

This summary outlines the foundational concepts of probability theory, focusing on finite sample spaces, probability distributions, and related principles. Understanding these concepts is crucial for solving complex probabilistic problems and applying probability theory in various contexts.



### Summary

The text covers several concepts and problems in probability theory, focusing on conditional probability, independence, and the application of these concepts in various scenarios.

#### Conditional Probability

Conditional probability is defined as the probability of an event \( E \) given another event \( C \), expressed as:

\[ P(E|C) = \frac{P(E \cap C)}{P(C)} \]

**Example Problems:**
1. **Rolling a Die:**
   - Probability of rolling a 3 given the outcome is odd: \( P(E_3|C) = \frac{1/6}{1/2} = 1/3 \).
   - Probability of rolling a 2 given the outcome is odd: \( P(E_2|C) = 0 \) since 2 is not odd.

2. **Arranging Letters:**
   - Probability of arranging "discrete" into "discreet" using conditional probabilities.

#### Independence of Events

Two events \( E \) and \( C \) are independent if:

\[ P(E|C) = P(E) \]

This implies:

\[ P(E \cap C) = P(E)P(C) \]

**Example:**
- Drawing an ace and a club from a deck are independent events.

#### Lottery and Expectation

The probability of winning the New York Lottery Mega Millions with one ticket is extremely low, approximately \( 5.69 \times 10^{-9} \). The expected value of a lottery ticket, given a $10,000,000 jackpot, results in a long-term loss of about 94 cents per dollar spent.

#### Bayes’ Theorem

Bayes’ formula relates the conditional probabilities of two events:

\[ P(C_j|E) = \frac{P(E|C_j)P(C_j)}{\sum_{i=1}^k P(E|C_i)P(C_i)} \]

**Example:**
- Probability of selecting a fake die given 10 consecutive rolls of 1s is calculated using Bayes' formula.

#### Bernoulli Trials and Binomial Distribution

Bernoulli trials involve repeated experiments with two possible outcomes. The probability of \( r \) successes in \( n \) trials is given by:

\[ P(r; n) = C(n, r) p^r q^{n-r} \]

**Example:**
- Probability of getting heads twice in three coin tosses.

#### Birthday Problem

The probability that at least two people in a group of \( s \) have the same birthday is calculated by considering the complementary probability that all have different birthdays. This probability exceeds 0.5 for \( s = 23 \).

#### Additional Problems

- **Geometric Probability:** Calculating the probability of two friends meeting within a time frame.
- **Dragon Shooting:** Probability of hitting a target with two shooters.
- **Classroom Lighting:** Probability distribution regarding functional lamps.
- **Dolphin Marking:** Probability of catching marked dolphins using combinatorial methods.

This text provides a comprehensive exploration of probability concepts with practical examples, illustrating the application of mathematical principles in real-world scenarios.

#### Exercises

The document provides exercises related to defining sample spaces, calculating probabilities in various scenarios, and understanding the behavior of random variables and events. These exercises aim to deepen understanding of probability theory and its applications.

Overall, the text serves as a comprehensive exploration of probability problems and an introduction to the theoretical underpinnings of computation through Turing machines.



The text explores Turing machines, a computational model more capable than finite automata. A Turing machine operates in discrete time, executing instructions and preparing for subsequent steps. It uses an infinite tape as a carrier, with each cell either empty or containing a symbol. The machine features a read-write head that reads, writes, and moves along the tape based on a controlling program. This flexibility distinguishes Turing machines from finite automata.

Turing machines can solve computable functions, though they are cumbersome to work with. An example problem involves designing a Turing machine to add two natural numbers. The process involves manipulating symbols on the tape to achieve the desired result. Variants of Turing machines, such as those with multiple tapes, are equivalent in computational power to the basic model.

The text discusses the unsolvability of the halting problem, a significant question in computer science. Alan Turing proved that no algorithm can universally determine whether any given Turing machine will halt. This issue is parallel to the Russell paradox in logic.

Complexity theory is introduced, focusing on algorithm performance, particularly running time and memory usage. The complexity of algorithms is often expressed using "Big O" notation, which describes the upper limit of an algorithm's growth rate. Different functions, such as logarithmic and exponential functions, exhibit varying growth rates.

The text touches on the distinction between P and NP classes of problems. P problems are solvable in polynomial time, while NP problems have solutions that can be verified in polynomial time but may not be easily found. Examples of NP problems include the Knapsack and Hamiltonian path problems.

Finally, the text differentiates between worst-case and average-case scenarios in algorithm analysis. The worst-case scenario considers all possible outcomes, while the average-case scenario assumes a probability distribution over outcomes, often providing a more optimistic estimate.

In summary, the text provides an overview of Turing machines, computability, the halting problem, algorithm complexity, and the P vs. NP problem, highlighting key concepts in computational theory and complexity.
