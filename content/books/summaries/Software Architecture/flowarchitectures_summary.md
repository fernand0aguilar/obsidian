3. **Interaction Components**: Established technologies like message processing and queueing are often in the Commodity phase. However, sources of events, such as new devices and data collection tools, are in the Product phase, reflecting their varying maturity levels.

4. **Infrastructure**: Most flow operations occur in the cloud due to benefits like scalability and reduced friction in development. Thus, infrastructure is placed in the Commodity phase.

#### Final Model and Next Steps

The final map provides a current view of flow integration needs. The next steps involve exploring technologies that fulfill these needs, focusing on event-driven systems' architectures and platforms. Future chapters will speculate on the evolution of flow based on the current map and technologies.

#### Evaluating the Current Streaming Market

The text outlines the importance of understanding streaming architectures and technologies driving their evolution. Three high-level technology categories are identified: service buses, message queues, and message-oriented middleware (MOM). MOM, for instance, facilitates asynchronous communication through message queues, decoupling producers from consumers and providing delivery guarantees.

Overall, the text emphasizes the strategic mapping of value chains to understand the flow and evolution of system components, preparing for future technological advancements in event-driven architectures.



Message queues and service buses play a crucial role in modern distributed systems by decoupling producers and consumers, allowing independent evolution and integration of components. This architecture supports scalability and flexibility, enabling new producers and consumers to be added easily. Pub/sub mechanisms are essential for precise message routing, maintaining their popularity in messaging systems.

Service-oriented architecture (SOA) emerged in the 1990s, introducing service buses to manage complex connections between diverse software components. Enterprise service buses (ESBs) provide a centralized communication platform, supporting data transformation, routing, and process management. However, ESBs face challenges with scalability and performance, leading to their use in specific clusters rather than entire enterprises.

The Internet of Things (IoT) revolutionized data flow through events, with devices using standard networking technologies like TCP/IP. IoT protocols such as MQTT have become pivotal, offering lightweight pub/sub messaging suitable for various applications. MQTT brokers manage message routing between producers and consumers, supporting asynchronous communication.

HTTP and WebSocket are also popular in IoT, albeit with different characteristics. HTTP is a request-reply protocol, while WebSocket enables two-way communication over TCP. Both facilitate point-to-point connections without pub/sub semantics.

Event processing architectures enhance data flow by introducing tools that process event stream traffic. These tools, including functions and real-time stateful systems, allow for quick, reactive event handling. Functions like AWS Lambda simplify attaching code to event streams for tasks like sorting and aggregation.

### Summary

In the realm of event-driven systems, ensuring secure and efficient data transmission is crucial. Various protocols like AMQP and MQTT are used for message transmission, often over TLS for encryption. However, these protocols differ significantly, lacking a unified method for encrypted event handling that any consumer application can interpret. The CNCF CloudEvents team is actively working to address this issue by exploring encryption handling in event communication, though encryption is not yet part of their specification.

HTTP, specifically HTTPS, relies on TLS for encryption but faces similar limitations without additional protocols. Companies often implement extra encryption layers for sensitive data, such as credit card information. A future flow protocol might not require explicit encryption support, instead carrying already encrypted data payloads. This approach offers flexibility but may lack optimization.

Connection security is vital to ensure events reach the intended consumers without interception. Protocols like TLS help mitigate man-in-the-middle attacks by using trusted certificate authorities for identity verification. However, TLS alone is insufficient for multi-hop or private network routing. Broker-based protocols like MQTT must find alternative ways to verify broker identities, potentially using encryption key technologies like X.509 certificates.

Data provenance ensures data integrity and authenticity, crucial for mission-critical applications. Current solutions, like checksums or ledger-based approaches such as blockchain, face challenges like performance issues and lack of widespread adoption. An effective solution for maintaining data provenance in fast-paced environments is yet to be developed.

Agility in the World Wide Web (WWF) is essential for adapting to changes while maintaining trust. Loosely coupled interfaces allow independent module modifications, enhancing system flexibility. Composability enables assembling solutions from known building blocks. A loosely coupled flow interface could use messaging-oriented connections, like Synadia's topic IDs, or REST APIs with standard HTTP commands. The final interface will likely blend these approaches, leveraging HTTP for server location and new mechanisms for streaming connections.

Protocols are key for software integration. A known and predictable protocol ensures reliable data exchange between producers and consumers. This involves understanding event metadata, which provides context and decryption instructions, and the event payload, which contains the actual data. As the field evolves, a standard interface for connecting to unique streams is anticipated, following patterns seen in cloud computing and container management.

Retention involves deciding how long events should remain available. This is complex, as retaining events too long increases storage costs, while short retention may lead to incorrect processing. Simple retention policies may suffice for many use cases, but some require more nuanced approaches.

Manageability of flow systems requires observability and controllability. Observability involves monitoring system operations to identify issues, while controllability allows operators to influence system behavior. Effective observability balances information sharing to maintain security and operational efficiency.

Overall, the development of flow systems involves addressing technical challenges in latency, retention, and manageability to ensure timely and efficient data processing. These systems may leverage edge computing and require careful architectural planning to optimize performance and scalability.



### Summary

The text explores the challenges and opportunities in the evolution of event-driven architectures, focusing on flow systems. It discusses the performance measurement of event processing, controllability, memory, intellectual property, and flow pattern challenges.

**Performance Measurement:** 
The text suggests that while cloud services provide events around state changes, they lack detailed performance data. It draws parallels with API-based integrations on the web, where services are expected to be reliable without offering extensive operational data. Flow producers might provide operational event streams to signal issues during passive event waiting.

**Controllability:**
In distributed systems, managing failures is as crucial as supporting normal operations. The text compares flow controllability to API operations, where service providers set operational contexts. In flow systems, either producers or flow services might set this context. When issues arise, consumers might need to change configurations or adapt to changes in event packaging. The text highlights the risk of unintended behaviors, like circular dependencies, which can lead to cascading failures. It underscores the importance of mechanisms to track event usage and counter feedback loops, such as circuit breakers.

### Summary

For decades, distributed systems have focused on reacting to events promptly, with high-frequency trading (HFT) systems as early examples. Derek Collison, a technologist in real-time messaging, identifies four basic use case categories for event streaming: addressing and discovery, command and control, query and observability, and telemetry and analytics. These categories help in designing better systems and identifying flow opportunities within IT portfolios.

#### Addressing and Discovery

Addressing and discovery involve tracking dynamic entities across systems, such as vehicles in logistics or servers in data centers. This process requires coordination across services to assign identifiers and manage entities effectively. Solutions include registration services, where agents signal their presence, and discovery services that monitor networks for agent transmissions. Challenges include handling duplicate discoveries and scaling to meet high rates of agent changes.

#### Command and Control

Command and control systems, like SCADA in industrial automation, link event sources to decision-making services. These systems orchestrate people, software, or devices to respond to state changes. Approaches include centralized systems that process events in real time and distributed control using edge computing to manage localized event traffic. Edge computing reduces latency and enables scalability by distributing decision-making closer to agents.

#### Query and Observability

This category involves monitoring individual agents or specific events to understand behavior. It focuses on real-time querying of event streams to gain insights into system operations. The goal is to enhance visibility and responsiveness to changes within specific domains.

#### Conclusion

Event streaming and messaging are crucial for modern distributed systems, enabling organizations to react quickly and efficiently to changes. By understanding and implementing the use cases of addressing and discovery, command and control, and query and observability, organizations can better integrate event-driven architectures to optimize their operations and prepare for future challenges.



In complex systems, understanding the state and behavior of agents is crucial. This involves querying and observability, where querying requires signals to request specific data from agents, and observability involves passively gathering data. Observability here refers to monitoring specific agents rather than a broad "collect everything" approach. For dynamic systems with numerous agents, using event streams for asynchronous communication can be more effective than traditional APIs. This allows for sophisticated queries and better handling of scale and network challenges.

Event processing systems can sort incoming data into topics for targeted processing, though this may lead to numerous topics. Alternatively, consumers can process a broader stream, filtering out irrelevant data, balancing producer-side and consumer-side processing. Modern platforms like AWS Lambda and Apache Storm offer viable solutions for these needs. Stateful stream processors are emerging as potential tools for observing and processing state data.

Telemetry and analytics focus on real-time insights into system behavior, crucial for applications like real user measurement (RUM) in ecommerce. RUM provides immediate insights into user behavior and campaign effectiveness, offering a competitive edge by allowing rapid response to data. The big data market, valued at $138.9 billion in 2020, encompasses various use cases, including sales and financial analytics, which benefit from near-real-time data processing.

Implementations of query and observability, as well as telemetry and analytics, often resemble Collector or Distributor pattern systems. Stream-based approaches are gaining traction over traditional batch processing, with projects like Apache Flink offering both batch and stream capabilities. Stateful stream processing engines, though still developing, promise to combine analytics with action, potentially using digital twin models for real-time decision-making.

Modeling complex activities using methods like EventStorming helps identify event-driven opportunities. EventStorming involves mapping business processes to event flows, capturing events, influences, commands, and policies. This method reveals organizational workflows and integration points with external systems, highlighting areas for improvement and flow opportunities.

When building systems for these use cases, architecture choices depend on functional, scale, and resilience requirements. Different scenarios require distinct architectures, with messaging and eventing serving different purposes. Eventing broadcasts facts, while messaging involves interaction. Understanding these distinctions helps in selecting the appropriate infrastructure for event-driven applications.

Overall, the focus on real-time data processing and event-driven architectures is crucial for modern businesses to gain insights and respond swiftly to changes, enhancing competitive advantage and operational efficiency.



In building flow-ready solutions for event stream processing, understanding the distinction between messaging and eventing is crucial. Messaging involves a two-way dialogue where producers and consumers coordinate activities, exchanging messages like "task completed." This requires maintaining state to track conversations, which can complicate scaling. Techniques such as sharding and consensus mechanisms help manage state distribution but add processing overhead and latency, impacting scalability. Edge computing can localize messaging, improving efficiency by isolating message distribution to servers with low-latency connections.

Eventing, on the other hand, is a one-way communication where producers broadcast facts without requiring feedback from consumers. This results in loosely coupled connections, allowing consumers to connect or disconnect without affecting producers. This flexibility encourages innovation by reducing risk. Eventing architectures can handle discrete events, where each event stands alone, or event series, where related events are analyzed together.

For discrete events, producers push events to consumers without additional consumer actions, minimizing promises between them. This allows producers to operate at high scale with minimal effort. Efficient architectures use push models, where producers send events directly to consumers. Consumers can provide mechanisms for receiving events, like Webhooks, which decouple the producer and consumer, enabling independent decision-making.

Event series require a pull model, where consumers retrieve event ranges from producers. Log-based queues like Apache Kafka excel here, maintaining event order and enabling large-scale processing. They support event series analysis by maintaining chronological event history, crucial for pattern recognition and machine learning applications.

Ultimately, choosing between messaging and eventing depends on the integration needs and the desired level of coupling between producers and consumers. Messaging suits scenarios requiring coordination, while eventing supports scalable, loosely coupled architectures. Edge computing and log-based processing are key strategies for optimizing these systems, enabling efficient, scalable event stream processing.



### Summary

In the evolving landscape of event-driven architectures, it's crucial to distinguish between single actions and workflows. Single actions involve discrete events processed by a single function or API call, while workflows require coordination across multiple steps and processors. Understanding this distinction helps developers choose the right architecture, saving time and effort.

**Single Actions**: These involve routing events to appropriate processors using services like Azure Event Hubs, Google PubSub, AWS EventBridge, or Knative Eventing. Serverless platforms allow developers to deploy functions that respond to events without managing underlying infrastructure. The simplest implementation involves configuring an event router to send events to a queue or directly to a function. For state tracking, stateful streaming platforms like Swim.ai are recommended.

**Workflows**: These track state across multiple steps and benefit from automation systems like AWS Step Functions or Azure Logic Apps. They simplify process management and allow for integration with third-party services. Workflow engines are ideal for complex processes requiring multiple interdependent actions, such as insurance claims or medical triaging.

**Driving Flow Forward**: The future of flow involves solving technical challenges like standardizing interfaces, ensuring scalability, security, and discoverability. A marketplace for streams is essential for innovation. Standards bodies like IETF, OASIS, and CNCF play a role in defining protocols, but open-source projects may significantly influence future standards.

**Open Source and Standards**: Open-source projects, particularly from the Apache Foundation and CNCF, are pivotal in event processing and queuing. Projects like Apache Kafka, Apache Beam, and Argo are key players. Open-source initiatives could define interfaces and protocols for the future Web of Flow (WWF).

**Entrepreneurship**: There are opportunities in data provenance, event data distribution tracking, coordination platforms, and monetization mechanisms. Entrepreneurs can drive flow forward by creating solutions that meet emerging needs.

**Building Flow Networks**: The success of flow relies on both the technology providers and the consumers. Businesses, governments, and nonprofits can act as catalysts for flow adoption by creating and consuming event streams.

In essence, the development of flow technologies presents significant entrepreneurial opportunities. By engaging in standards development, contributing to open-source projects, and fostering flow networks, individuals and organizations can shape the future of event-driven architectures.



### Summary

The text discusses the importance of establishing common interfaces and protocols for event-driven integration across organizations, drawing parallels with past initiatives like Electronic Data Interchange (EDI) in the financial sector. Trade associations and industry groups play a crucial role in creating standards that facilitate seamless data exchange, reducing risks and making commerce more efficient. The insurance and financial industries, for example, have numerous trade groups that work on integration standards.

Participation in existing trade associations can be beneficial for companies aiming to adopt event-driven integration. However, gaining access to decision-making committees can be challenging. Companies not part of trade groups might consider forming new organizations focused on flow standards, especially as new use cases emerge. Government regulations also influence integration standards, acting similarly to trade associations in setting guidelines for product and service integration.

Market ecosystems, where a core vendor enables other vendors to build complementary software, are another avenue for establishing integration standards. Amazon Web Services (AWS) serves as a prime example, having set standards for image packaging, container images, and event formats. Such ecosystems create predictable integration behaviors, reducing development costs for vendors. Dominant vendors can drive others to align with their integration requirements, as seen with Microsoft, Twitter, and Facebook.

Startups often succeed by adding value to existing platform ecosystems, targeting the ecosystem's customer base. This model benefits both product and service companies. Building a positive feedback loop within the ecosystem can enhance market presence, as seen with Forte Software's strategy in the 1990s. Companies can also explore existing streams to provide value-added services, though they risk competition from the platform vendors themselves.
