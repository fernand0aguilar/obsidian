## Ideal Business Model

6 Metrics that come into play:

1. **Unitary Gain** - 
	How Much Money you make per transaction 
	**Goal: $1500+**
1. Startup Capital - 
	How much money you need to invest to get the business off the ground
	**Goal: $0**
1. Profit Margins - 
	How much you keep out of everything you make in revenue
	**Goal: 60 ~ 98%**
1. Demand - 
	Number of people in the makerket looking to buy your product/ service
	**Goal: HIGH**
1. Fulfillment -  
	The process of delivering the product / service your customer purchased
	**Goal: EASY**
1. Deal Type -
	Whether you get paid once or recurrently
	**Goal: RECURRENT**
	
	
Solution: 

### Service-based business

* Clients paying you for the service
	Recurring montly payment of
		$1.500 to $10.000

* Virtually no startup capital
* 60 to 97% profits

The Business model is:
> Selling ROI Marketing and development Services for Small Business

Arbitrage of supply and demand

Customer w/ a problem > brand > Solution

- **Contractor Arbitrage**
	
	1. Setup
	2. Pick
	3. Arbitrate
	4. Reach Out

When you execute this process correctly you should be able to get 3-4 new clients per month...

At $2000/month each, that's $6000 to $8000 in new monthly recurring revenue each month...
