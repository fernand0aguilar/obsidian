**Market Capitalization** is the total value of a company's outstanding shares of stock. It’s calculated by multiplying the current share price by the total number of shares. Market cap gives an idea of a company’s size and market value.

### Emergence in Economic Context

**[[Emergence]]** in economics can be seen in how market values and company equity develop over time. Just as in [[complex systems]], the market cap and equity of a company are not just the sum of its parts (assets and liabilities) but also include intangible factors like brand value, market sentiment, and innovation. 

These values emerge from the interactions between the company’s operations, its stakeholders, and the broader market environment.

think of market cap and equity as measures of a company’s value in the market. However, this value doesn’t just come from adding up the company’s assets. It emerges from many interconnected factors like how well the company is managed, how it innovates, and how it interacts with the broader market.

- **Yellow-stage thinkers** see the company as part of a complex system. They focus on understanding how different parts of the company work together to create value over time.
- **Turquoise-stage thinkers** take this further by considering the global impact of the company. They believe that companies creating value for society and the environment will ultimately have stronger market caps and equity because they are aligned with a more sustainable and ethical future.

In essence, both market cap and equity can be seen as emergent properties of a company’s overall health, strategy, and its place within the broader market and global system.
