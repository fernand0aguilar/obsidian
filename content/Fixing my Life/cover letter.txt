Hi Coinbase People,

My name is Fernando and I have 6 years of professional experience as a developer. I've studies Software Engineering for the university of Bras√≠lia and in the graduation could learn a lot about the techniques, good practices and technical aspects.

I've been interested in machine learning, blockchain and software development processes for most of the time and it's an opportunity like working in coinbase that makes me want to keep learning about this topics.

I've previously worked in projects including these topics and feel that working in coinbase is just a big enough leap. I am ready to embrace the challenges and the inner aspects of this position and appreciate the opportunity to talk further about it.
