Man, I wish I had a list like this in my 20s.

Plenty of hardship would have been avoided.

These are the mistakes I'd tell myself to avoid if I could speak to my younger self:

1. Worry about what you 'should' be doing

Some people are lucky and fall into the ideal career early.

Most do not, and that's ok.

Spend less time concerned about what you should be doing, and instead experiment.

Now is the time to see where your strengths lie.

2. Not building life-long connections

This is different to your TikTok or Instagram following. I'm talking about developing your Rolodex network.

Tomorrow's dream future clients and employers are met in-person or online today.

You want to avoid joining the 'resume queue' for creating work.

Standing out and reaching out directly to job-givers via your network remedies this.

Start getting into the habit of connecting with interesting people early.

3. Ignoring your inclinations

Stop sitting on the sofa watching Netflix all day. This is your avoidance manifesting.

Do what excites you and comes from a place inside you that can't be explained. Follow your insights about 'how cool it would be to do this.'

Maybe you had this thought that learning woodwork would be cool.

Or creating an app or learning the bassoon. Follow your weird.

Pursue these little tickles of insight - this is your genius calling.

4. Investing too deeply into something you will later regret

Be extremely careful about taking on big life commitments - like marriage, mortgages, children, and even long-term relationships - that can imprison you for decades if you choose poorly.

Be aware and give big life decisions a lot of thought before jumping in.

Freedom and long-term happiness must be your priority.

5. Get into poor physical exercise habits

It's easy to look around you and follow the majority - sedentary and unhealthy.

But everything improves when you regularly exercise.

It's foundational and the cheat code to an energised life.

6. Not adequately setting yourself up for location independence

We're moving into a time where being tied to any geography will bring you potential hardship down the line.

We have flexibility if we structure our lives that way.

You don't want to find yourself in an unstable country when you could have had the option to be free and move.

7. Not learning about personal finance and investing

When you ask most people of any age what their most significant stresses are, money is always up top.

Get ahead by learning what to do and avoid when it comes to money.

Managing your money well from a younger age will put you at a tremendous advantage.

8. Watching porn

Avoid this stuff like the most viral disease.

Getting into the habit of this high-stimulation substance will lead to problems like broken relationships, erectile dysfunction, depression, anxiety, and a general numbness to life.

Get off it now.

When you do, life takes on a new colour.

9. Getting into poor thought habits

I would have avoided struggle if I'd understood how to think in a way that kept me at peace most of the time.

Most of us have poor thought habits.

We use worry as a terrible 'life management strategy.'

We buy into the 'seriousness' of our thoughts when we need to let go in reality.

Stressful thoughts will weaken you.

10. Taking on debt

Debt must be avoided unless you are wise with it and use 'good' debt to build your business.

Debt imprisons you financially and creates continual stress that will limit you creatively.

If you have debt, you want to prioritise working it off asap.

11. Not developing a consistent writing habit

Writing consistently (including journaling) was one of the best habits I developed in my twenties.

Writing developed my confidence and brought me opportunities like:

• Speaking worldwide,

• A growing audience,

• Books and courses I could sell,

12. Not handling social anxiety

If you get overly fearful around people, you want to use your twenties to get a handle on this.

Expose yourself to what you fear and practice to diminish the fear. It isn't about 'personality' - and no one is born with it - it's about practice.

13. Not developing a portfolio of creative assets

Focus less on 'career' and more on building assets.

Assets hold value, bring you stability, create leverage, and bring in cash flow.

Things like design skills, books, courses, public speaking experience, newsletters, and YouTube videos.

All this is monetisable value that will bring people to you and create long-term stability.

14. Spending time with losers

Avoid people who drain your energy and make you feel worse in their presence.

It's not worth it when so many fascinating and enriching people out there can lift you up.

15. Not setting aside any money to invest

I wish I'd started prioritising investing sooner.

Compounding is a thing and will work for you in incredible ways over time.

You could have your finances sorted in your thirties by learning and committing to investing young.

16. Not getting good at at least one high-income skill

Being self-taught in design in my twenties and building a global business from scratch was one of the best things I did.

I now have a skill I can use to pay the bills whenever I choose.

It also gave me experience in creating clients, running a business and speaking with people.

17. Investing too much into formal education

I had fun at university, but my time there was not required. I studied both Geography and then later Real Estate.

Some professions require a degree.

Most do not, and most people waste tremendous resources at colleges when they could have developed their own skills with the help of the Internet.

My entire career is based on free learning from the net.

18. Trying to impress family and friends

Most people make decisions because they want to make other people happy, at the expense of their own happiness. This is a mistake.

Be selfish with your choices because if you are unhappy, the world loses.

You must prioritise yourself.

19. Not travelling

Though I wouldn't want you to create a situation for yourself where you cannot travel later in life, you want to take advantage of your youth for travel.

This especially applies to 'rougher' forms of travel like backpacking.

Your twenties are a fantastic time to experience different cultures and harden yourself to the enlivening challenges that travel can bring.

20. Neglecting your spiritual growth

The sooner you get a sense of the spiritual, the more resilient you will be.

Mental strength for me is not possible without an understanding of consciousness and our connectedness to all things.
