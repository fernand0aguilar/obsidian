# Gratitude

---

There is a Law of Gratitude, and it is absolutely necessary that you should observe the law, if you are to get the results you seek.

---

The law of gratitude is the natural principle that action and reaction are always equal, and in opposite directions.

---

The grateful outreaching of your mind in thankful praise to the Supreme is a liberation or expenditure of force; it cannot fail to reach that to which it is addressed, and the reaction is an instantaneous movement toward you.”

---

“Draw nigh unto God, and He will draw nigh unto you.” That is a statement of psychological truth.”

---

“The whole process of mental adjustment and atonement can be summed up in one word, gratitude.”

---

“First, you believe that there is one Intelligent Substance, from which all things proceed; 

second, you believe that this Substance gives you everything you desire; 

and third, you relate yourself to It by a feeling of deep and profound gratitude.”

---

“It is easy to understand that the nearer we live to the source of wealth, the more wealth we shall receive; and it is easy also to understand that the soul that is always grateful lives in closer touch with God than the one which never looks to Him in thankful acknowledgment."

---

The more gratefully we fix our minds on the Supreme when good things come to us, the more good things we will receive, and the more rapidly they will come; and the reason simply is that the mental attitude of gratitude draws the mind into closer touch with the source from which the blessings come.”

---

“If it is a new thought to you that gratitude brings your whole mind into closer harmony with the creative energies of the universe, consider it well, and you will see that it is true. 

---

"The good things you already have have come to you along the line of obedience to certain laws. Gratitude will lead your mind out along the ways by which things come; and it will keep you in close harmony with creative thought and prevent you from falling into competitive thought.”

---

“Gratitude alone can keep you looking toward the All, and prevent you from falling into the error of thinking of the supply as limited; and to do that would be fatal to your hopes." 

---

"“And if your gratitude is strong and constant, the reaction in Formless Substance will be strong and continuous; the movement of the things you want will be always toward you.”

---

“To fix your attention on the best is to surround yourself with the best, and to become the best.”

---

“The grateful mind is constantly fixed upon the best; therefore it tends to become the best; it takes the form or character of the best, and will receive the best.”

---

“It is necessary, then, to cultivate the habit of being grateful for every good thing that comes to you; and to give thanks continuously."

---

"And because all things have contributed to your advancement, you should include all things in your gratitude.”

---

“This will bring you into harmonious relations with the good in everything, and the good in everything will move toward you.”
