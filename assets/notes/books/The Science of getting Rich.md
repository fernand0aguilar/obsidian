“Do not forget for a moment that the Thinking Substance is through all, in all, communicating with all, and can influence all." 

---

The desire of Thinking Substance for fuller life and better living has caused the creation of all ”

---

“Your part is to focalize and express the desires of God.”

“You need not hesitate about asking largely; “it is your Father’s pleasure to give you the kingdom,” said Jesus.

---


Original Substance wants to live all that is possible in you, and wants you to have all that you can or will use for the living of the most abundant life.

---

If you fix upon your consciousness the fact that the desire you feel for the possession of riches is one with the desire of Omnipotence for more complete expression, your faith becomes invincible.


---

God, the One Substance, is trying to live and do and enjoy things through humanity. He is saying, “I want hands to build wonderful structures to play divine harmonies, to paint glorious pictures; I want feet to run my errands, eyes to see my beauties, tongues to tell mighty truths and to sing marvelous songs, and so on.


---

“All that there is of possibility is seeking expression through men. God wants those who can play music to have pianos and every other instrument, and to have the means to cultivate their talents to the fullest extent;"


---

"He wants those who can appreciate beauty to be able to surround themselves with beautiful things; He wants those who can discern truth to have every opportunity to travel and observe; He wants those who can appreciate dress to be beautifully clothed, and those who can appreciate good food to be luxuriously fed."


---

"He wants all these things because it is Himself that enjoys and appreciates them; it is God who wants to play, and sing, and enjoy beauty, and proclaim truth, and wear fine clothes, and eat good foods."


---

“It is God that worketh in you to will and to do,” said Paul.


---

The desire you feel for riches is the Infinite, seeking to express Himself


---

So you need not hesitate to ask largely.


---

Your part is to focalize and express the desires of God.
