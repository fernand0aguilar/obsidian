{The Second Proclamation}

# We Will Replace Presentations With Conversations

We will break free of our addiction to the big reveal and the adrenaline rush that comes from putting ourselves in the win-or-lose situation of the presentation. 

When we pitch, we are in part satisfying our craving for this adrenaline rush, and we understand that until we break ourselves of this addiction we will never be free of the pitch. 

Presentation, like pitch, is a word that we will leave behind as we seek conversation and collaboration in their place.

To wean ourselves of our addiction **we must take the first step of changing our behaviour with our existing clients. **

Once we have accomplished this, the second step – **changing the way we behave with prospective clients in the buying cycle** – becomes possible. We will explore how to take these two steps, but first let us examine the hidden costs of pitching.
