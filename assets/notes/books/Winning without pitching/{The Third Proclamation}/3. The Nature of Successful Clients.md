# The Nature of Successful Clients

Clients are stinging scorpions that cannot be trusted. 

The lesson is that the most successful clients, whether owners or executives, have achieved their success in part because of their ability to take control – their ability to rise above and orchestrate others. 

This is their strength; and even though it is not always in their best interest, it is in their nature.

We are liable. Like the frog, we are the guilty party when we let the client control the engagement and dictate to us how we will go about understanding his problem. 

Just because it is in the client’s nature to lead, does not mean he should be allowed to do so at all times. 

It only means that, like the scorpion, he will attempt to do what it is in his nature to do.
