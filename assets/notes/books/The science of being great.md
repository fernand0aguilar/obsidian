# The science of being great
You are not mentally developed by what you read but by what you think about what you read. 

Thinking is the hardest and most exhaustive of all labor. 

Face thought. Dare to think great thoughts.

We never move forward until we begin to think about it.

Read about great things and think about great questions

Think about questions of eternal truth, human rights and justice.

Think great thoughts and become a great man. 
Thinking is growth. Thinking uses more and more of yourself.

Think for yourself. All that man do is an expression of thought.

No action is possible without thought. 
And a great action is preceded by a great thought.

Action is the second form of thought. 
And personality is the materialization of thought. 
Environment is the result of thought.

Things group themselves and arrange themselves around you according to your thoughts. 

There is some central idea and conception of yourself by which all the facts of yourself are arranged and classified.

Change the central idea and you change the arrangement or classification of all the facts and circumstances of your life. 

You are what you are because you think as you do.
You are where you are because you think as you do.

Think about the point of view.

1. The thought that you live in a perfect world. Among perfect people, and that nothing can possibly be wrong with you unless it's your personal attitude. 
2. Consider that this is gods world and that its the best of all possible worlds. That he has brought thus far into completeness by the process of organic, social and industrial evolution. And that is going on to greater completeness and harmony.
3. There is one great perfect intelligent process of life causing all the changing phenomena of the cosmos

Think about all this and comprehend how you should live and act as a citizen of such a perfect whole.  

Think about how this great intelligence is within you, and its your own intelligence, your internal light empowering you to do the right thing, and the best thing, the greatest act and the highest happiness.

It is a principle of power within you giving you all the ability and genius there is. It will guide you to the best if you will submit to it and walk into the light and obeying your soul.

Think about your identification with this great supreme, how all this knowledge is yours and all this wisdom is yours for the asking.

You are a god if you think like a god.

If you think like a god, you will act like a god. 

Divine thoughts will externalize themselves.
Thoughts of power will lead to a life of power.
Great thoughts will manifest in a great personality.

Think well of all this and you are ready to act.
