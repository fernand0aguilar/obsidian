Psychology is the basics of human understanding and it means that for us to learn psychology means also that we are learning how to tap into the otehrs persons ideans and perspectives and thus by only tapping we are able to interact with them and plant seeds of words that we say. because they become so only emotional and reactive and thus we become able to make others do what we want them to do. this is the art of [[persuasion]] and charm and charisma to be able to select and determine the life that we live. And only by becoming a prince of peace is when im going to focus on another goal.
