This is something to be studied, understood and voluntarily applied  to attain definite desired ends.

Hypnotic Rhythm is something resembling a magnet which attracts things for which it has a magnetic affinity.

This explains why people succeed in any undertaking find that success multiplies with less effort as times goes on. 

All successful people use hypnotic rhythm either consciously or unconsciously by expecting and demanding success. 

Nature forces in the minds of men the influence of their environment, which are stronger than their own thoughts. 

Children are forced to take on the nature of all influences of those around them unless their own thoughts are stronger. 

Nature sets up a definite rhythm for every environment, and everything in the range of that rhythm is forced to conform to it.

Man alone has the power to establish his own rhythm of thought providing he exercises this force before hypnotic rhythm is forced upon in the influences of his environment.

Each individual has his own rhythm of thought. 

The person who thinks in terms of power, success, opulence sets up a rhythm which attracts these desirable possessions.

Success and failure are results of habits. It establishes one's rhythm of thought and that rhythm attracts the object of one's dominating thoughts.  

The law of harmonious attraction translates it into its physical equivalent.
