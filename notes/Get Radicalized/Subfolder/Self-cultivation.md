[[RADICAL ACCEPTANCE + RADICAL RESPONSIBILITY]]

1/ If I could only pick two psychological techniques to transform yourself, they would be: RADICAL ACCEPTANCE (of yourself & reality) + RADICAL RESPONSIBILITY (of your behavior not outcomes) This is how you unite unconscious & conscious to become unstoppable.
