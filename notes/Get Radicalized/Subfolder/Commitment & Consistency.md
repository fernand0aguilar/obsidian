# How to Stay Committed & Consistent (Mastery Level)

Once we commit to something – we feel an overwhelming need to stay consistent with that commitment.

That’s not magic,

That’s how our human psychology works.

**Your commitment will set consistency in motion.**

But how do we commit to starting our first agency and closing that first client?

How do we take that first leap? 

What if I told you I knew the secret approach that has helped top agency owners not only take that first leap but also, 

>> Reach their vision quicker

>> Be more productive

>> Hire people that are passionate 

>> Make ridiculous revenue

And you can implement it today.

There's a common pattern between successful agency owners vs non successful. 

Understanding and accepting that pattern allowed me to **make multiple 7 figs by the age of 23 through my own agency.**

No, it isn't a crazy strategy. 

No, it isn't something you can copy and paste.

It's unique & involves thinking

It's simply a concept that only one that is truly passionate about a business can create.

It's a North Star.

#### _What is a North Star?_

Your end goal & main milestones to help you create something in your head.

Everything you work on a daily basis will bring you closer to it.


```
"We are stubborn on vision. We are flexible on details.” 

- Jeff Bezos 
```

There is too much confusion around the difference between a North Star and Strategy.

Bezos explains it perfectly here - **strategies can change (the details) but the vision (North Star) remains the same.**

For example,

A revenue growth plan is a strategy.

Wanting to own your own agency is a vision.

Now, how do you build your vision or your North Star, in our case which is to start our very own agency?

## Ask yourself the following questions:

-   Who do you want to help, what specific cause are you supporting to fix with your agency?
    
-   What are your audience's main problems? 
    
-   If the problem didn’t exist, how would the world be? Explain how beautiful life could be without that problem
    
-   Why do you want to help your audience with this problem? What is your true reason + passion behind finding this solution?
    
-   How can the world be a better place if you solved this problem for that 1 SINGLE CLIENT with your agency business?
    

Now, when you find answers to these questions. **FORM YOUR VISION** through the formula below.

**Part 1:** Where do you see your agency in 5 years (in simplistic terms)?

**Part 2:** Why are you doing what you are doing?

**Part 3:** Who are you doing it for?

A vision will give your agency _"a sense of purpose"_.

Now when you’ve constructed your vision, you’ve laid the foundation of your agency already.

Next, you need to be willing to make a commitment to work towards your vision. You need to have an intention that you’re going to start your agency and stay committed to it.

You need to have an intention that you are going to go full force with it or else your mind is just going to go here and there and wander - without a goal. 

Gladly we’ve already defined our goal/our North Star for this specific journey which is, 

_To build a successful agency that’s going to bring us cash flow._

That’s our end goal. Now you need an intention that you are going to do everything in your power to achieve that goal - no matter how difficult, no matter how annoying, no matter how tiring you get, you’ll find a way to get it done. That is the most important thing. 

Now you need to stay consistent with it. 

Struggles will be inevitable - your goal is to find a way to maneuver around them before they come up. But, you need to adopt the following mechanism to deal with your failures;

**Start your agency → fail → make improvements → fail → happy end solution**

Most people give up at the first or second fail - they take it as a hit on their ego and fall into a victim state. This is weak behavior, it shows you do not have a firm grasp on your vision.

If you are solution-focused and expect this pattern you will know the end of every struggle in life is a burst of euphoria and happiness.

The core lesson I want to give you for today is - always expect to do more iterations, always expect new barriers in life, but have the intention that you will solve those problems.

Because if someone sells you a life of 0 problems, 0 barriers, they are lying straight to your face.

If you think owning an agency will not have any sort of struggles, then you are in for a rude awakening.

But, you’re not alone. We’d help.

**We can give you everything.** 

**We’re giving you everything we can on a golden plate but it’s actually up to you to follow through with it.**

If you **DO NOT** follow through with it then that’s actually your fault but these milestones are here to keep you consistent with your goal.
