	“An aspirational diet will have you dreaming of success; but it’s the attachment of expectations and tangible goals that feeds the desire, persistence, and fortitude required to make the win.”  
	— Lorii Myers

Time is the friend of the person who trains his mind to follow positive thought habits and the enemy who drifts in the negative thought habits...

All people can be classified as drifter and non-drifters.

Most of the difficulties that people face are of their own making. Difficulties seldom are the outgrowth of the immediate circumstances. They are generally the climax of a series of circumstances which had been consolidated through the habit of drifting and the aid of time.

Take any circumstance you wish, measure it with its measure to the relationship to the habit of drifting hypnotic rhythm and time and you may ascertain accurately the cause of all success and all failure.

The amount of drifting is always offset by a sufficient major purpose which  can restore the courage and start once more the quest of knowledge every time one is defeated in connection with the minor aims.

The habit of drifting is hazardous and only 2% have a definite major aim in life. The other 98% is caught in the habit of drifting.

One can avoid the majority of the temporary defeats which one meets if he is definitely following a plan for the attainment of a major purpose in life.

This happens in business and marriages. The majority of couples get out of harmony with each other because of the accumulation of a great number of little circumstances in their married relationship. Which could have been cleared up and disposed when they arouse if there had been a definite policy to do so.

The man with the most definite plan and purpose and the most power rides on to victory. The others scurry for cover and get crushed under the heels of those who are more determined.

Victory goes to the people who know what they want and are determined to have it. They have mastered the habit of drifting, with definite policies, definite plans, and definite objectives. 

Their opposition has no chance against them because the opposition has no plan, no purpose, no policy, instead that of drifting along hoping that something may turn up to help them.

There is a simplicity of the law through which one can transmute the desires into substantial form without having to undergo so many years of hardship and misery. Understand this concept and you will be able to avoid some of the hurdles that you're forced to jump as you walk in the valley of life.

The water with which those fires of hardships are finally extinguished is at your command in great abundance. Failure can be converted into success by having a clear definite aim and persistence.

Both success and failure are the results of day-to-day evolutionary forces through which dominating thoughts are pieced together bit by bit and woven into the things we want, or the things we do not want, according to the nature of those thoughts.

Someone who has a definite aim and purpose. 

Here’s the description of a “non-drifter”, 

1.  He is always engaged in doing something definite, through some well-organized plan which is definite. He has a major goal in life to which he is always working, and many minor goals, all of which lead toward his central scheme.
2.  The tone of his voice, the quickness of his step, the sparkle in his eyes, the quickness of his decisions clearly mark him as a person who knows exactly what he wants and is determined to get it, no matter how long it may take or what price he must pay.
3.  If you ask him questions, he gives you direct answers and never falls back on evasions or resorts to subterfuge.
4.  He extends many favors to others, but accepts favors sparingly or not at all.
5.  He will be found up front whether he is playing a game, or fighting a war.
6.  If he does not know the answers he will say so frankly.
7.  He has a good memory; never offers an alibi for his shortcomings.
8.  He never blames others for his mistakes, no matter if they deserve the blame.
9.  He used to be known as a go-getter, but in modern times he is called a go-giver. You will find him running the biggest business in town, living on the best street, driving the best automobile, and making his presence felt wherever he happens to be.
10.  He is an inspiration to all who come into contact with his mind.
11.  The major distinguishing feature of the non-drifter is this: He has a mind of his own and uses it for all purposes.
