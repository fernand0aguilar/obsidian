# Critical Thinking

**Critical thinking** is thinking about things in certain ways so as to arrive at the best possible solution in the circumstances that the thinker is aware of. 

it is a way of thinking about whatever is presently occupying your mind so that you come to the best possible conclusion.

### Someone with critical thinking skills can:

-   Understand the links between ideas.
-   Determine the importance and relevance of arguments and ideas.
-   Recognize, build and appraise arguments.
-   Identify inconsistencies and errors in reasoning.
-   Approach problems in a consistent and systematic way.
-   Reflect on the justification of their own assumptions, beliefs and values.

### The Benefit of Foresight

Perhaps the most important element of thinking critically is foresight.

Almost all decisions we make and implement don’t prove disastrous if we find reasons to abandon them. However, our decision making will be infinitely better and more likely to lead to success if, when we reach a tentative conclusion, we pause and consider the impact on the people and activities around us.

The elements needing consideration are generally numerous and varied. In many cases, consideration of one element from a different perspective will reveal potential dangers in pursuing our decision.

# Definitions

Traditionally, critical thinking has been variously defined as follows:

-   "The process of actively and skillfully conceptualizing, applying, analyzing, synthesizing, and evaluating information to reach an answer or conclusion"
-   "Disciplined thinking that is clear, rational, open-minded, and informed by evidence"
-   "Purposeful, [self-regulatory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-control "Self-control") judgment which results in interpretation, analysis, evaluation, and inference, as well as explanation of the evidential, conceptual, methodological, criteriological, or contextual considerations upon which that judgment is based"
-   "Includes a commitment to using reason in the formulation of our beliefs"
-   The skill and propensity to engage in an activity with reflective skepticism (McPeck, 1981)
-   Thinking about one's thinking in a manner designed to organize and clarify, raise the efficiency of, and recognize errors and biases in one's own thinking. Critical thinking is not 'hard' thinking nor is it directed at solving problems (other than 'improving' one's own thinking). Critical thinking is inward-directed with the intent of maximizing the rationality of the thinker. One does not use critical thinking to solve problems—one uses critical thinking to improve one's process of thinking.
-   "An appraisal based on careful analytical evaluation"
-   "Critical thinking is a type of thinking pattern that requires people to be reflective, and pay attention to decision-making which guides their beliefs and actions. Critical thinking allows people to deduct with more logic, to process sophisticated information and look at various sides of an issue so they can produce more solid conclusions."
-   The desire to reach for a satisfactory result, and this should be achieved by rational thinking and result-driven manner. Critical thinking firstly involves learned abilities such as problem-solving, calculation and successful probability application. It also includes a tendency to engage the thinking process. 
-   "Critical thinking is essentially a questioning, challenging approach to knowledge and perceived wisdom. It involves ideas and information from an objective position and then questioning this information in the light of our own values, attitudes and personal philosophy."

- being open-minded to different sides, 
- being able to think systematically,
- being analytical, 
- being persistent to truth, 
- being confident about critical thinking itself,
