six universal signatures in human aesthetics:[[26]](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aesthetics#cite_note-Dutton-26)

1.  Expertise or virtuosity. Humans cultivate, recognize, and admire technical artistic skills.
2.  Nonutilitarian pleasure. People enjoy art for art's sake, and do not demand that it keep them warm or put food on the table.
3.  [Style](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Style_(visual_arts) "Style (visual arts)"). Artistic objects and performances satisfy rules of composition that place them in a recognizable style.
4.  Criticism. People make a point of judging, appreciating, and interpreting works of art.
5.  Imitation. With a few important exceptions like abstract painting, works of art simulate experiences of the world.
6.  Special focus. Art is set aside from ordinary life and made a dramatic focus of experience.
