# Developing self discipline
1. **Resist impulses** — Resist all urges to eat/drink snacks, grab a treat, buy something or check social media. 
2. **Love pain** — Everyday take yourself to the dark places, confront difficulties, feel the pain and love it. 
3. **Exercise** — Work out first thing in the morning (everyday) regardless of whether you want to and love the burn.
4. **Eat clean** — Get a healthy diet plan and stick to it. Weening yourself off flavor will sharpen your senses and mind.
5.  **Meditate** — Meditate for 20mins everyday before work and do it religiously without ever missing a single day. 
6.  **Sleep** — Sleep is self discipline, make sure you go to bed and wake up at the same time everyday. Don’t waver.
7.   **Organization** — Keep your office, house, car, drawers, desktop, email and everything in your life clean/organized.
8.   **Time management **— Plan your months, weeks, days and hours deliberately and stick to it and say no to everything. 
9.   **Set goals** — Always look at your vision/mission, annual goals, monthly goals and your war map action planner. 
10.  **Gratitude** — Always looking to the future can cause fear/anxiety/stress, practice gratitude daily to balance yourself.
11.  **Relentless persistence** — Stick to your plan daily and never waver despite emotion, drama, failure or uncertainty. 
## Finding things to sacrifice 
* 100 Units of Time — This is a powerful exercise I do monthly to see where my time goes. 
	* How it works — For 7-days, track what you do every 30-minutes (set an alarm) by writing it down in a journal. At the end of 7-days, categorize activities into buckets and then calculate how much time went into each bucket. 
	* Sacrifice — Every activity that isn’t related to your goal, eliminate it completely. I don’t care about your feelings, if you want to win you’ll get rid of it. If you want to hang on to your little thing, do it, just know it’ll cost you everything. 
	* But I can’t — I can hear you saying it already, and it’s bullshit. You can get rid of it, you just don’t want to and you’re scared. You’ve created a lie in your head that this thing is necessary and that your business/you need it. You don’t. 
	* Even my family? — Not your wife, family or your health. You still need sleep, food, exercise and a loving relationship, without these things your limbic system will play havoc with you and harm your focus. You will spend less time though.
	
### Systems and tools to stay on the rails 
* Vision, mission and principles — Keep these handy and look at them multiple times /day, everyday! 
* Baseline self & future self — Keep your Alchemy of Self workbook handy and look at it everyday! 
* Self discipline — Keep your inputs consistent: Food, exercise, hydration, sleep, meditation, behavior, etc. 
* Oura Ring — Keep oura data updated
* Health tracking sheet — Use the sheet to track your daily health inputs (in resources section). 
* War map calendar — Use this to plan your years, months, weeks, days and hours (in resources section). 
* RICE prioritization tool — Use this tool to prioritize the order of project execution (in resources section). 
* Standardized metrics — Use key metrics to measure your businesses outputs; Revenue, profit, growth, etc. 
* Third party observer — If you’re extreme, get a live in coach/trainer to observe you and keep you focused.
