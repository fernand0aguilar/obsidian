Being _good at being a man_ is an anthropological category of manliness.

It emerges from the realities of biology, evolution, and the environment.

## **A Three-Fold Path**

### Protect
The essence of protection is the “need to establish and defend boundaries.”

Boundaries create a sense of identity and trust. Should that line be crossed, men will spring into action.

A man adds to his individual honor by developing and demonstrating prowess in the protector role.

### Procreate
The imperative to procreate essentially requires that a man act as pursuer of a woman, successfully have kids, and thus create a “large and vigorous family” that expands his lineage as much as possible.

The procreator role requires:

-   Acting as the initiator in the seduction/courtship of women.
-   Virility and potency – the ability to “get it up.”
-   The ability to sexually satisfy a woman.
-   Fecundity and having as many children as possible.

### Provide
The provider role requires:
-   **Contributing** the lion’s share of sustenance to one’s tribe/family (about a 70/30% split
-   **Resourcefulness** – cleverness, the ability to maneuver around obstacles, come up with creative solutions to problems, turn scarce resources into something of value.
-   Becoming **self-reliant** – be fully autonomous and provide for others.
-   Being **generous** with your community – a man who does well for himself is expected to give back.

### **The Elements that Underlie the 3 P’s**

**An earned status**
	Manhood must be earned through merit
	
**Autonomy**
Autonomy involves the “absolute freedom of movement”. It means being able to make your own decisions, call your own shots, create your own goals, set your own pace, carve your own path.

**Energy**
A man is expected to overcome passivity, to always be up and doing, and to ceaselessly strive to achieve.  A man is charged with taking the initiative in any endeavor, be it courtship or business.

**Danger and risk**
 All of the imperatives are set up as win/lose propositions. Risk may take the form of bodily harm or simply the blow to one’s manly reputation that comes from the failure to demonstrate competence in the standards of manhood. Most seriously, “losing” may mean losing one’s life. To win means gaining greater access to resources and the respect and honor of one’s fellow men and tribe. Mens’ greater amounts of testosterone fuel the desire to take these risks.
 
**Competition**

Each of the manly roles involves competition between men to be the best 
– 
to bag the most game, accumulate the most wealth, give away the most wealth in the provider role; to marry the most wives, have the most kids, seduce the most women in the procreator role; to demonstrate the greatest strength, courage, mastery in the protector role. Men want to best their fellows, rise to the top, and be crowned with honor.

**Public affirmation**

When it comes to excellence in the 3 P’s — talk doesn’t matter, results do. You have to put your money where your mouth is, and thus competence in all the manly pursuits must be demonstrated in the public square and affirmed by others. You must be willing to sally forth into the fray, to compete with other men, and show how you stack up against them.

**Create more/consume less**

The ultimate standard for each of the imperatives, and for the mantle of manhood itself, is to create more consume less. To be a man is to demonstrate competence in the manly role – to pull one’s own weight, to be a contributor rather than a sponge, a boon rather than a burden to one’s people.

This means adding to your tribe’s reputation for strength instead of detracting from it through physical frailty and cowardice, choosing fecundity over sterility, and providing something of value to society’s pot instead of only taking from it.
