PURPOSE: 

YOU NEED TO KNOW THE PURPOSE OF EACH MEETING 

TIME RESTRICTIONS ARE GOOD. but you really need someone who is chairing the meeting and can get the meeting back on track if it diverges and topics will diverge and go on a tangent, these are dangerous

DO I NEED TO BE ON THIS CALL? Sometimes when i have clashes what i do, is meet with someone who attended the meeting and they give me a verbal update 

MEETINGS ARE BOTH UNDERRATED AND OVERRATED AT THE SAME TIME there is a culture of shitting on meetings, but this is premature because one of the main issues with corporate culture is that context is lost in written updates:

Too much useless meetings and communication wastes everyone’s time. I always ask if I am needed on a call if I have priorities I’ll attend those instead. Also this is why you need to set up reporting lines to funnel information.

MEETINGS ARE HATED BECAUSE THEY ARE RUN BY PEOPLE WHO DONT KNOW HOW TO RUN MEETINGS a good meeting is worth it. the amount of clarity and alignment achieved over a short discussion can solve months of back and forths

TIME SPANS lower time span covered in the meeting = shorter the meetings you dont need an hour long meeting for a daily meeting but you may need more than an hour if you have a meeting covering topics that are for a quarter of a year.

REMOTE MEETINGS meetings are more important now than ever. different language = different culture = different contexts all cant be communicated through words just look at how easily attacked people feel about twitter... words on a screen.


HARD STOPS meetings running over usually mean the meeting was bad if you did not cover everything you planned to in the allotted time it means you are a bad predictor and estimator of the topics you are discussing. you will improve with time tho

Too much useless meetings and communication wastes everyone’s time. I always ask if I am needed on a call if I have priorities I’ll attend those instead. Also this is why you need to set up reporting lines to funnel information.


INFORMATION CAPTURE there needs to be some sort of knowledge capture into forms that can be archived. so take notes or record the meetings and archive these. these help ppl joining or for retrospectives.


i try to write notes in all meetings that i have with people if time and convenience, because writing is long and memory is short even if it is somewhat photographic.


dont rebuild things that are already built if you are starting off. i do project management consulting and the common thing i notice with coders is that they want to build a cathedral, but really they need a quick bazaar shop speed => traction


When booking calls through instant messaging. If I have 5 mins I ask the person if they’re free now for a quick call or if they got 5 mins. Got told this was bad once. BUT I disregarded that free advice lol. Quicker you solve problems. The more money you make.

GOOD MEETING HOSTS ARE GOOD PEOPLE PERSONS if you are good at parties you will be good at hosting meetings. same rules apply

LEARN HOW TO MULTITASK i have mutliple screens and i keep up correspondence with multiple people while paying attention on meetings. you learn how to understand the rhythm and flow of meetings. so you can drop in and drop out easily

THE CALENDAR IS YOUR FRIEND more information that exists before and after the meeting the smoother it will go

THE MOST SENIOR PERSON DOESNT ALWAYS LEAD was in a 9am briefing with the CTO of a billion dollar company he was being briefed. he wasnt leading. sometimes this can get mixed up, it is okay to have help, as long as everyone understands.

IT IS BETTER TO HAVE 2 30 MINS MEETINGS THAN 1 HOUR MEETING. (if they are kept on topic and on track) peoples attention is limited.

TIME IS NON LINEAR you dont waste ONE HOUR, if there are 10 people you waste 10 hours, for a bad 1 hour meeting.

SALES CALLS if you are doing sales calls. having them go on forever is bad. just like in romance, leave them begging for more, starting and ending on a high note.

HAVING GOOD MEETINGS Starts with remembering people are human too. I always start small. Ask how they are. Learn a thing or two by what they say or what they don’t say
