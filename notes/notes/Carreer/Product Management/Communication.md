# What is language
Language involves everything. From colors, things, the visual aspecs. To musics and specific intruments to give a tone in the music, it can be a happier tone, a mellow tone.

Even Marketing, sales, persuasion are tied together in studies of language. 

Language is a way of transportation to which things happen. Communication and language is being improved. Now we are transitioning to a more visual and text based language. 

The communication has to be selective for it to have quality. If you donate your full energy for everyone that comes across your communication field, you're going to feel depleted at the end. So be mindful of who are you communicating with and chose to give your attention only to a few selected group.


# Verbal Language

Select and expose your ideas in the semantic way. 

Clarity is the first item in improving  your communication

A good communication process happens in the following way. 

You think of an idea and have to put this idea in the other person mind. 

When the idea arrives in the other person's mind, it has to be the closest as possible to the initial idea that you've thought. 

When you speak, often times it's a complex idea, and you end up stumbling when speaking, with distractions and other beliefs from the listener. Which causes the other person not understanding the message. 

This item can be solved by adopting a strategy of linear thinking. 

Everytime we have an idea, it doesn't come alone, it usualy brings other ideas and thoughts with it. This is when they get mixed up. 

Sometimes we're speaking of something specific, and in the middle, another thought about another subject gets in the way. Running over the communication process, we get lost into it and doesn't seem able to finish the initial thought with clarity.

Linear thinking is a good strategy to have clarity in the communication process... It means to have a single point of focus each time you're speaking. 

Thinking and speaking about one single thing at a time. And every time you begin an idea, you finish an idea before starting another idea. 

Orators use this strategy a lot. It is crucial to them because it brings about an organization of ideas beforehand. 

It means having a phrase with a beginning, a middle and an end. And then speaking it outloud.When conveying a new idea, it is necessary to have influence and grab the attention. 

And using the linear strategy makes this process more fluid and give you time to think.
