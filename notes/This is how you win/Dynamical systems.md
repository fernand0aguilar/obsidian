In dynamical systems theory one is interested in what happens when one follows a typical orbit: is there some kind of attractor which usually occurs?
Dynamical systems become interesting when the transformation suffices to produce interesting behavior. 

The orbit of a single point may be a geometrically complex set. 

As we discover, dynamical systems are sources of deterministic fractals. The reasons for this are deeply interwined with ifs theory. 

# Shift dynamical system

By studying the orbits of these systems, we will learn more about fractals

dynamics of a simple mobius transformation. Points spiral away from one fixed point and they spiral in towars the other. what happens if the fixed points coincide?  

repulsive fixed point

attractive fixed point in the plane

points belonging to an orbit of a mobius transformations on a sphere

## We get order by subtracting
subtraction being a more fundamental operation than addition
