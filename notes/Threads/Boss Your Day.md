[[3) Find your focus. You are responsible for all of your problems and all of your accomplishments. Recognize strengths as well as weaknesses and know where your focus always needs to be.]]

[[6) Decide. Make the choice to start being a better person. Quit putting off fixing your shit. Own it and decide to be better. Success waits for no one. Decide. Act. Adapt. Thrive.]]

[[7) Judge others less. Judge yourself more. If you can’t change it, it can’t control you. Move on. Forgive. Fix. Grow.]]

[[8) Create systems, not goals. Focus on process and not the end results. Embrace procedures and tasks. Learn how to do the small things consistently that add up to big things. Systems create results. Not goals.]]

[[9) Expand your consciousness. The process of finding yourself or finding the meaning of life is critical for self development. Take time to focus on these things, expand your range of thought, meditate and and allow your mind to delve into uncharted territories.]]

[[10) Laugh more. Seek out the things in life that make you laugh, spend time with people who make you feel good. Life is too short to waste on anything less.]]

[[11) Learn the power of no. Stand up for yourself and your beliefs. You are on a mission and distractions need to be shut out. If it does not align with your goals, say no.]]

[[12) Practice forgiveness. You can’t move forward without moving on. Forgive, but don’t forget.]]

[[13) Create more than you consume. Build systems, create products and leverage consumers. The more you can create in this life the more you can give and the more you give the more you get. Karma is real.]]

[[20) Fail. Find something you want to try and fail. You can’t get better at something if you never try and you can’t grow if you never fail. Fail. Fail fast and fail often. Learn from your mistakes, correct them and battle through adversity.]]

[[21) Keep a journal. Writing down your thoughts, goals and plans is the best kind of therapy a person can give themselves. Journaling keeps you focused and in tune with your passions. Aim to write and read daily to see the compound benefits of each.]]

[[22) Own up to your shit. If you make a mistake or a poor decision, the quicker you own it the quicker you solve it. Recognizing that mistakes happen and you can’t make every correct decision is a life hack. This trait alone will save you years of struggle.]]

[[23) Start strong. Do important tasks in the morning. What you prioritize after waking up in the morning will surely dictate the rest of your day. The night before plan your day and tackle the tough tasks as early as possible!]]

[[24) Focus on your breathing. Different breathing patterns activate different parts of the brain. Slow down and pay attention to your breathing. Paced, focused breathes immediately improve focus, attention and regulate the nervous system.]]

[[25) Make a bucket list. Life was meant to be enjoyed. Your dreams, your passions... Write them down and start working toward them! You only get one life, make it count!]]

[[26) Learn how to make money 24/7. If you can’t make money 24/7, then you can’t fully maximize your time alive. Create a brand. Create products. Create an ebook. Sell a skill. Consult. Learn how to make passive income, so you can live life while your money works for you.]]

[[27) Travel far away. To live, but never truly explore all this world has to offer is one of life’s great tragedies. This world has so much to offer, it is your duty to go out into the world and find out!]]

[[28) Be selfish. Never be afraid to prioritize what is most important to you. Sometimes you need to tell people no so you can say yes to the things you value most. Live your life by your values and never be afraid to be selfish.]]

[[29) Meditate daily. Even if it’s just one one minute. Spend some intentional time daily to reflect, plan and be mindful of the moment. Meditation relieves stress, increases imagination, creativity and gives you a new sense of awareness and well being.]]

[[30) Make a daily to do list. Everyday.... Add deadlines, add goals, create systems. Plan your day before it happens and then hold yourself accountable. You have no idea how much you can accomplish in one day until you try.]]

[[31) Spend time in nature. Connecting with nature is one is one of life’s greatest gifts you can give yourself. Spend some time alone or with friends and family. But get outside and clear your mind of the clutter. Become one with nature to become one with your soul.]]

[[32) Other people’s opinion doesn’t matter. To live your life worried about others is to live a lie. Find yourself, be true to yourself and never stray from that person. Accept your faults for what they are and ever stop working on them.]]

[[33) Push past physical limits. Find your barriers and break through them. This is what makes weightlifting such a challenge because there is always more weight that can be added. But the same applies to running, bicycling, basketball, hiking, climbing or any physical task.]]

[[34) Try new things. It’s easy to get stuck in your daily routine and fall into “no” mode. But, to fully experience all life has to offer you need to know when to say no and when to say yes. Trying new things and experiencing new feelings is a sure fire way to level up life.]]

[[35) Help someone in need. The gift of life is giving. To receive anything you have to first be willing to give everything. Open up your heart, your mind and your souls to the benefits of helping others to in turn receive help when you don’t even know you need it.]]

[[36) Dare to live. Most people simply exist. I challenge you to not only live, but to thrive. 
	- Learn new skills. 
	- Travel the world. 
	- Start a family. 
	- Embrace your fears. 
	- Give love to get love.]]

[[37) Appreciate the simple things. Life is fleeting and the little things matter. Learn how to focus on them more to fully experience their true beauty. A simple walk alone on the beach, in the woods or simply down your street can lead to some powerful moments.]]
