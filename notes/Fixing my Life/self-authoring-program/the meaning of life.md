1.  You need to choose a worthy _purpose_ or a significant life goal.
2.  You need to have sufficient _understanding_ of who you are, what life demands of you, and how you can play a significant role in life.
3.  You and you alone are _responsible_ for deciding what kind of life you want to live, and what constitutes a significant and worthwhile life goal.
4.  You will _enjoy_ a deep sense of significance and satisfaction only when you have exercised your responsibility for self-determination and actively pursue a worthy life-goal.
