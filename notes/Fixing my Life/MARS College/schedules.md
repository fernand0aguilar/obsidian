# Kanban
This gives teams more flexible planning options, faster output, clearer focus, and transparency throughout the development cycle.


## What is kanban?
A basic kanban board has a three-step workflow: To Do, In Progress, and Done.

### Planning flexibility

A kanban team is only focused on the work that's actively in progress. Once the team completes a work item, they pluck the next work item off the top of theÂ backlog.

The product owner is free to reprioritize work in the backlog without disrupting the team, because any changes outside the current work items don't impact the team.

As long as the product owner keeps the most important work items on top of the backlog, the development team is assured they are delivering maximum value back to the business. 

So there's no need for the fixed-length iterations you find in scrum
