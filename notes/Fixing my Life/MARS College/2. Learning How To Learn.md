### “Focused” and “Diffused” Modes

The best strategy is to switch back and forth between both modes multiple times.

_This help us learn anything faster and also avoid unnecessary stress on our brain._

---
**Focused Mode** 

is when you are putting stress on your brain.

> In short: All those activities that force you to pay attention and use your willpower are performed under Focused Mode.

(ex: solving problems, preparing for exams, thinking about complex questions)

---
**Diffused Mode** 

It's when you are not using your brain too much. 

When you relax for a few minutes after a pomodoro session.

> (ex: staring at the ceiling, listening to music, chatting with your friends, etc.)

---
So when you get stuck, take a break.

Look outside and watch other people. Or listen to your favorite song. **Drink some water.**

Give your mind some time to relax. Do whatever you want. Just get away from your desk and take a walk.

And then come back later and attempt to solve the problem once again.

### Chunking
	Divide and conquer

**Chunking** is a process by which pieces of an information set are broken down and then grouped together in a meaningful whole. 

---

-   If a topic seems overwhelming, divide it into smaller chunks and learn them one by one. Every following concept will be easier
---
- First Principles thinking
	- Master the major ideas before diving deep into the details. Skim through the material to get the general idea or a concept.

---
### Illusions of Competence

-   You have to solve the problem by yourself. Understanding or seeing the answer does not mean that you have internalized and learned it. Be careful of Illusion of Competence.

---
If you're trying to build connections between chunks, before basic chunks are embeded in the brain, it doen't work as well.
	
	it's almost as if 
	
	learning a complex chess strategy before learning the basic moves.

### Recall

We forget 20–40% of the information in the first 24 hours

---

After you've read the material, simply look away, and see what you can recall from the material you've just read. 

---

Let time pass betweel recall exercises, so that it becomes a spaced repetition, 

The retrival process helps us building in neural hooks that we can hang our thinking on.

---

Recalling is a powerful tool. 

To make even better use of it, practice recalling concepts outside your place of study, so that you become independent of the cues from any one given location.

### Bite-Sized Testing

Just wanting to learn the material and spending a lot of time with it doesn't guarantee that you'll actually learn it. 

Testing allows you to recall and see wheather or not you really grasp an idea. 

---

If you make a mistake in what you're doing, it's actually a very good thing. 

Mistakes are very valuable to make in your little self tests before high stakes real tests.

Because they allow you to make repairs and you're thinking flaws bit by bit. Correcting your thinking so that you can do better next time.

---
### Deliberate Practice

Its the honing of the craft.

If you just show up and work hard, you'll soon hit a performance plateau beyond which you fail to get any better

That is, deliberate practice might provece the key to quickly become an expert
