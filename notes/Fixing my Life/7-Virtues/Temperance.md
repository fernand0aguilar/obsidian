TemperanÃ§a is https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperance_(virtue)

Marcus aurelius:

temperance separates humans from animals, writing that: 

> it is the peculiar office of the rational and intelligent motion to circumscribe itself, and never to be overpowered either by the motion of the senses or the appetites, for both are animal; but the intelligent motion claims superiority and does not permit itself to be overpowered by the others[.]

For Marcus, this rational faculty exists to understand the appetites, rather than be used by them. 

In the ninth book of the _Meditations_, he gives this advice:

> "Wipe out imagination: check desire: extinguish appetite: keep the ruling faculty in its own power."
