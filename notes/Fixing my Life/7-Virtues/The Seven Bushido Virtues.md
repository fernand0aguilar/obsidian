“IN JAPAN THERE were several sources of Bushido; perhaps I may begin
with Buddhism. It furnished a sense of calm trust in Fate, a quiet submis-sion to the inevitable, a stoic composure in the face of danger, a disdain of
life, and friendliness with death. A foremost teacher of swordsmanship,
when he saw his pupil master his art, told him, “Beyond this point my in-
struction must give way to Zen teaching.” Zen is the Japanese equivalent for
Dhyana, which “represents human effort to reach through meditation zones
of thought beyond the range of verbal expression.”* Its method is contem-
plation, convinced of a principle that underlies all phenomena, and
putting oneself in harmony with the Absolute. Whoever attains to the per-
ception of the Absolute raises himself above mundane things and awakes,
“to a new Heaven and a new Earth.”
