## Usability test
"Usability testing is a black-box technique. The objective is to observe real users using the product to discover problems and points of improvement. The product, which can be a website, a web application, a physical product, does not have to be completely developed. Prototypes are widely used in usability tests to validate what is being done." - Caelum

The usability test to be developed will be based on the [article by Jakob Nielsen](https://www.nngroup.com/articles/why-you-only-need-to-test-with-5-users/) who says that the ideal number of people to test a product is 5.

As a methodology for carrying out the test, the 5-step interview will be used, a UX technique created by Michael Margolis and taken from the book Design Sprint.

Below is the base template created for the interview:

## Interview in 5 steps
### 1. friendly greeting

Hello, good afternoon/good morning, thank you very much for helping us. We are trying to test our solution and find ways to improve it. Your opinion is important to us.

Remembering that the test is informal and you don't have to be afraid to answer the questions as honestly as possible.

We'll record your interaction with the product so we can identify issues and potential improvement needs, okay?

Well, let's start with a few questions just to put our product in context.

### 2. Customer Contextualization
* Do you have a salesfroce plus account? If yes, what, in your opinion, is the main advantage?
* How often do you use your account?
* Do you like the content? does it help you?
* Do you know the dreamforce? Have you seen it? What do you think about this service?
* What is your main motivation for using this service or not?


### 3. Product presentation

I'll explain the situation to you: 

"You want to signup to salesforce plus and be able to watch series and content"

The product allows you to choose between a wide range of original content. In it, before you signup you get to watch trailers and go to the series pivot, through which you can:
```
 * Add series to the list
 * See all episodes
 * choose an episode
 * copy video URL
 
```

### 4. Tasks
* Analyze and annotate user reactions while performing the following flows:
	* signup to watch
	* choose an original series
	* watch an episode
	* Use the whole system

``` 
To test the use of salesforce plus, consider the following scenarios:

> Scenario 1

    The user signs up

> Scenario 2
	
	The user browse through list of available series
     
> Scenario 3
	The user chooses a serie and watches a trailer

> Scenario 4
	The user saves the serie to my list, and clicks on more up next episodes
      
```


### 5. debriefing

* Would you use the salesforce plus service? Why?
* What did you like least about the use of salesforce plus?
* What was your impression of the process of activating the account?
* What was your impression of the process of visualizing your available series?
* What was your main difficulty in the use of the salesforce account?
* What did you like most about the APP? And what would you change?
