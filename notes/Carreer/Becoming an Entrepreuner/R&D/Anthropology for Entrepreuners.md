In 1988, military strategist, John A. Warden III introduced the Five Ring System model in his book, The Air Campaign, contending that any complex system could be broken down into five concentric rings.

Each ring—Leadership, Processes, Infrastructure, Population and Action Units—could be used to isolate key elements of any system that needed change. The model was used effectively by Air Force planners in the First Gulf War. 

Warden applied his model to business strategy.

# Warden’s Five Rings to evaluate your Operations

## Leadership - 
this is the center of the system, the most important in your center of gravity and requires the constant ability to stay relevant, gather, process and act on information for your operations on a strategic level.

## Organic Essentials - 
In a system, without this key resource it will not survive. In a business, this is the structure to support your people so they have the resources available to innovate and evolve the business through raw materials and energy.

## Infrastructure - 
the support structure to for the inner and outer rings, how the organization delivers these services through brick and mortar operations or dot.com. It is the muscles and bones in your business that allows the system to move and execute.

## Population -
This is your team, the larger group. How are you supporting them, giving them the resources to excel, stay relevant and delight your customers. You need their support and alignment; they need your leadership and organic essentials within the system to do their business.

## Fielded Forces - 
A steady stream of people within the system who comprise the fighting force, who are coming up with the next big ideas and supplying/supporting the system to be a competitive force. These are the white blood cells, what keeps the system healthy but also what does the operational and tactical execution of the leadership’s strategy.
