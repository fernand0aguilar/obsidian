# What is design?

```
Beginning -> indentify the needs and requirements -> (re)design -> build an interactive version -> evaluate -> final product -> beginning
```

-   Analysis: Study and plan the current situation;
-   Synthesis: Plan and execute and intervention on the current situation
-   Evaluation: Verify the effect of the intervention, compare the analyzed status previously with the new situation, achieved after the intervention

It's about knowing the involved elements and the relationships between them. From among all different elements, such as:

-   people,
-   artifacts
-   process

All designs are like trouble shooting, they are like a movie, you see it in your head, you visualize every step of the way and only when you see it all clearly do you code any of it.

That is the way I troubleshoot and the way I design, a movie playing endlessly in my head until I have it all then I sit down and spit it all out.
