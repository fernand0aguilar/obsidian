# FullStack WebApp

process stripe transactions




mimic all the endpoints from the rec api and do them in node

with graphql and psql

and do them. in a way that is going to become easier to maintain

go back to the frontend react native code

maitain that code too, change it with the other code from lighthing leads

**3.Â  Architectural Goals and Constraints** **
> There are some key requirements and system constraints that have a significant bearing on the architecture. They are:

What am i trying to achieve here? 

Design the backend of the Rec system in order to map all the endpoints and all the routes and replicate them in nodejs
-  The existing system should allow an user to log in with their google account
-  The system must redirect the user a dashboard page 

Think that it is work for 3 to 6 weeks


i could do the backend in django after deploying
but first i'm gonna need to deploy
and in order to do that i've got to apply to a developer acount and to do that i've got to go through all the process of deploying an app to the app store and then i'll have 1 in 2 milion apps there
