# We Will Specialize

The world does not need another generalist design firm. There are enough full service advertising agencies and marketing communication firms. 

The world is drowning in undifferentiated creative businesses. What the world needs, what the better clients are willing to pay for, and what our people want to develop and deliver, is deep expertise.

Expertise is the only valid basis for differentiating ourselves from the competition. Not personality. Not process. Not price. It is expertise and expertise alone that will set us apart in a meaningful way and allow us to deal with our clients and prospects from a position of power.

Power in the client-agency relationship usually rests with the client. His power comes from the alternatives that he sees to hiring us. 

When the client has few alternatives to our expertise then we can dictate pricing, we can set the terms of the engagement and we can take control in a manner that better ensures that our ideas and advice have the desired impact.

It is first through positioning our firm that we begin to shift the power in the buy-sell relationship and change the way our services are bought and sold. 

Positioning is the foundation of business development success, and of business success. If we fail on this front we face a long, costly uphill journey as owners of creative businesses.
