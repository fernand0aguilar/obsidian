## A Manifesto of Business Practices for Creative Firms

The forces of the creative professions are aligned against the artist. These forces pressure him to give his work away for free as a means of proving his worthiness of the assignment. 

Clients demand it. Designers, art directors, writers and other creative professionals resign themselves to it.

But while collectively the battle may seem lost, a revolution is afoot. 

Some creative firms are fighting and winning. They are reclaiming the high ground in the client relationship, beating back the pitch and winning new business without first having to part with their thinking for free. They are building stronger practices amid the forces of commoditization.

This treatise contains the twelve proclamations of a Win Without Pitching firm. It describes a trail blazed by owners of creative businesses who have made the difficult business decisions and transformed their firms, and the way they go about getting new business. 
They have gone from order-taker suppliers to expert advisors and have forged a more satisfying and lucrative way of getting and doing business.
