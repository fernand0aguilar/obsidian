# Practitioner or Performer?

Even when we pitch and win, we lose. We devalue what should be our most valuable offering and set up the wrong dynamics between the client and us.

We must move away from the place where the client sits with arms crossed in the role of judge, and we take to the stage with song and dance in the role of auditioning talent. 

While both parties find the showmanship of our craft titillating, the practitioner’s is a stronger place than that of the performer. 

It is this practitioner’s position from which we must strive to operate. Practitioners do not present. Stars do not audition.
