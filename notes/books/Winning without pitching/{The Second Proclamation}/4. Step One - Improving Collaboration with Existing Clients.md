# Step One: Improving Collaboration with Existing Clients
[[5. The Rules of Collaboration]]
[[6. Step Two - Eliminating Big Reveals in the Buying Cycle]]
Making the big reveals small and reducing our dependency on the presentation requires us to work more closely with the client. 

This creates a challenge: how to invite him in without allowing him to drive? This delicate balancing act of bringing him closer without conceding control can only be achieved when we establish and communicate the rules of the engagement. Alas, another challenge: **we’ve never been fond of rules.**

When we do not clearly spell out how we will work together we leave a void that the client is quick to fill. 

Thus begins the erosion of the power we worked so hard to obtain by following the first proclamation. Nature abhors a vacuum. If we do not drive the engagement, of course the client will.

When we establish the rules of collaboration – to use first with our clients and then with our prospective clients – we ensure that all engagements begin with both parties understanding how we will work together.
