# Summary

	“An aspirational diet will have you dreaming of success; but it’s the attachment of expectations and tangible goals that feeds the desire, persistence, and fortitude required to make the win.”  
	— Lorii Myers

Time is the friend of the person who trains his mind to follow positive thought habits and the enemy who drifts in the negative thought habits...

All people can be classified as drifter and non-drifters.

Most of the difficulties that people face are of their own making. Difficulties seldom are the outgrowth of the immediate circumstances. They are generally the climax of a series of circumstances which had been consolidated through the habit of drifting and the aid of time.

Take any circumstance you wish, measure it with its measure to the relationship to the habit of drifting hypnotic rhythm and time and you may ascertain accurately the cause of all success and all failure.

The amount of drifting is always offset by a sufficient major purpose which  can restore the courage and start once more the quest of knowledge every time one is defeated in connection with the minor aims.

The habit of drifting is hazardous and only 2% have a definite major aim in life. The other 98% is caught in the habit of drifting.

One can avoid the majority of the temporary defeats which one meets if he is definitely following a plan for the attainment of a major purpose in life.

This happens in business and marriages. The majority of couples get out of harmony with each other because of the accumulation of a great number of little circumstances in their married relationship. Which could have been cleared up and disposed when they arouse if there had been a definite policy to do so.

The man with the most definite plan and purpose and the most power rides on to victory. The others scurry for cover and get crushed under the heels of those who are more determined.

Victory goes to the people who know what they want and are determined to have it. They have mastered the habit of drifting, with definite policies, definite plans, and definite objectives. 

Their opposition has no chance against them because the opposition has no plan, no purpose, no policy, instead that of drifting along hoping that something may turn up to help them.

There is a simplicity of the law through which one can transmute the desires into substantial form without having to undergo so many years of hardship and misery. Understand this concept and you will be able to avoid some of the hurdles that you're forced to jump as you walk in the valley of life.

The water with which those fires of hardships are finally extinguished is at your command in great abundance. Failure can be converted into success by having a clear definite aim and persistence.

Both success and failure are the results of day-to-day evolutionary forces through which dominating thoughts are pieced together bit by bit and woven into the things we want, or the things we do not want, according to the nature of those thoughts.

## The law of hypnotic rhythm


Someone who has a definite aim and purpose. 

Here’s the description of a “non-drifter”, 

1.  He is always engaged in doing something definite, through some well-organized plan which is definite. He has a major goal in life to which he is always working, and many minor goals, all of which lead toward his central scheme.
2.  The tone of his voice, the quickness of his step, the sparkle in his eyes, the quickness of his decisions clearly mark him as a person who knows exactly what he wants and is determined to get it, no matter how long it may take or what price he must pay.
3.  If you ask him questions, he gives you direct answers and never falls back on evasions or resorts to subterfuge.
4.  He extends many favors to others, but accepts favors sparingly or not at all.
5.  He will be found up front whether he is playing a game, or fighting a war.
6.  If he does not know the answers he will say so frankly.
7.  He has a good memory; never offers an alibi for his shortcomings.
8.  He never blames others for his mistakes, no matter if they deserve the blame.
9.  He used to be known as a go-getter, but in modern times he is called a go-giver. You will find him running the biggest business in town, living on the best street, driving the best automobile, and making his presence felt wherever he happens to be.
10.  He is an inspiration to all who come into contact with his mind.
11.  The major distinguishing feature of the non-drifter is this: He has a mind of his own and uses it for all purposes.

Most of the difficulties of which people find themselves are of their own making.

Moreover, difficulties seldom are the outgrowth of the immediate circumstances. 

Success or failure are generally the climax of a series of circumstances which had been consolidated through the habits and the aid of time.

The man with the most definite plan and purpose, and the most power rides on to victory.

Victory goes to the people who know what they want and are determined to have it. 

They have mastered the habit of drifting, they have definite policies, definite plans, and definite objectives.

Their opposition, which may outnumber them, has no chance against them because the opposition has no plan, no purpose, no policy, except that of drifting along, hoping that something may turn up to help them.

This is the difference between success and failure, power and lack of it.

	One's dominating desires can be crystalized in their physical appearec trhough definiteness of purpose backed by definiteness of plans, with the aid of natures law of hypnotic thythm and time.

# The habit of drifting
Definiteness of purpose 

The power of non-drifting.

The law of success and its correlation to having a major aim in life.

Dedicating life to a specific purpose and pursuing it with all means possible.

The majority of temporary defeats which one meets can be avoided if one is definitely following a plan for the attainment of a major purpose in life.

# The law of Hypnotic Rhythm
Stopping fear and supplanting with faith.

The good and the bad. 

Positive and negative.

# The element of time
Failure as a stepping stone.

Restart every time you get defeated in connection with minor aims.

Caution in dealing with associates.

Patience!

The majority of married people who get out of harmony with each other do so because the accumulation of a great number of little circumstances in their relationship which could have been cleared up and disposed of as they arose if there had been a clear policy to do so.



The difference between 

- Adversity, defeat, failure.

The failure often serves as a blessing from the sky. 

How to rise to great heights of achievement using the law of hypnotic rhythm

Failure is a man made circumstance. It is a state of mind and something that the individual can control. Failure is only permanent if the individual accepts it as being so. It brings a climax where one has the privilege of breaking his mind of fear and making a new start in another direction. It proves that something is wrong with one's aims or the plans by which the object of these aims are sought.

Failure gives people an opportunity to test himself. Wherein one may learn how much willpower he possesses, and also forces one to learn many truths they were not going to discover without it. The successes of many people is usually an exact ratio to their experiences of defeat before succeeding.



The developed sources of knowledge are limited. Every normal adult human brain is a potential gateway to all the knowledge there is throughout the universe. Every normal adult brain has within its mechanisms the possibility of direct communication with infinite intelligence where it exists all the knowledge that is or can ever be communicated.


# Time

Time is the law of hypnotic rhythm. The lapse of time required to give permanency to thought habits depends upon the object and the nature of the thoughts. 

The only enduring thing in nature is change. If that is true, time divides all the thought habits into two classes. Negative thoughts and positive thoughts. One's individual thoughts are constantly changing and being recombined to suit the individuals desires. But thoughts do not change from negative to positive or vice-versa. 

Except trough voluntary effort on the part of the individual. Time rewards the individual for all positive thoughts. According to the nature and purpose of the thoughts. If one's dominating thoughts are positive, it's woven by time into permanent habits.

People are not born with wisdom. They are born with the capacity to think and they may through the lapse of time, think their way into wisdom. Wisdom comes only through the lapse of time to non drifters who form positive thought habits as a dominating force in their lives. 

# Wisdom

Wisdom is the ability to relate yourself to natures laws so as to make them serve you. And the ability to relate yourself to other people so as to gain their harmonious willing cooperation in helping you to make life yield whatever you demand of it. 

Accumulated knowledge is not wisdom. To convert knowledge into wisdom one needs time, plus the desire for wisdom. Wisdom is acquired if at all by positive thinking through voluntary effort. 

The majority of people who acquire wisdom do so by the age of 40. Prior to that time the majority of people are too busy gathering knowledge and organizing it into plans to spend any effort seeking wisdom. 

Adversity and failure are the circumstances most apt to lead one to acquire wisdom, and only for those who are ready for wisdom and have voluntary sought it, which readiness is determined by time and the nature of thought habits. Knowledge tested through the test of time is always superior to that which has been newly acquired. Time gives to knowledge definiteness in both quality, quantity, and dependability. Dependable knowledge is the kind which harmonizes with natural law.

# Harmony

Nature forces everything within a range of given environment to become harmonious related. 

This is why the association with negative minds is fatal to those seeking self-determination. Nature voluntarily forces human beings to harmonize with the influences  of their environment. The law of hypnotic rhythm forces the dominating influences of the environment in which it exists. 

Change your environment or remain poverty-stricken. Nature permits no one to escape the influences of his environment, however nature in the abundance of wisdom has given to every normal human being the privilege of establishing its own mental, spiritual and physical environment. 

Once he establishes it, he must become a part of it. This is the inexorable working of the law of harmony. The individuals who act with definiteness of purpose are the ones who establish the dominating influence that determines the rhythm of the environment. 

Definiteness of purpose is the starting point from which an individual may establish his own environment. The dominating influences of the world are positive and thus nature is forcing human beings to harmonize with the dominating influences of the world environment. 

Manifestations of harmony may be positive or negative. Harmony means that nature relates everything in the universe to every other thing of a similar nature. 

Negative influences are forced to association with one another, no matter where they may be. 

Positive influences are just as definitely forced into association with one another. 

Successful business leaders are so careful in the choice of their business associates because men who succeed in any calling usually established their own environment by surrounding themselves with people who think and act in term of success.  

Observe with profit that the one thing all successful men insist upon is harmony  among their business associates. 

Another trait of successful people is that they move with definiteness of purpose and insist upon their associates doing the same. 

Understand this two truths and you will understand the main difference between a Henry Ford and a day laborer.


# Caution

The lack of caution is, next to the habit of drifting, the most dangerous human trait.

People drift into all sorts of hazardous circumstances because they do not exercise caution by [[planning]] the moves they make.

The drifter always moves without exercising caution. He acts first and thinks later if at all.

He does not choose his friends. He drifts along and allows people to attach themselves to him on their own terms. He does not choose an occupation. He drifts through school and is glad to get the first job that will give him food and clothing. He invites people to cheat him a trade by neglecting to inform himself of the rules of trade. He invites illness by neglecting to inform himself of the rules of sound health. He invites poverty by neglecting to protect himself  against the environmental influences of the poverty-stricken. He invites failure at every step he takes by neglecting to exercise the caution to observe what causes people to fail.  He invites fear in all its forms by his lack of caution and examining the causes of fear. He fails in marriage because he neglects to use caution in his choice of a mate. And he uses even less caution in the matters of relating himself to her after marriage. He loses his friends or converts them into enemies by his lack of caution and relating himself to them on the proper basis.

 The non-drifter always uses caution.
 
 He carefully thinks his plans through before he begins them. He makes allowances for the human frailties  of his associates and plans ahead to bridge them. If he sends a messenger on an important mission, he sends someone else to make sure the messenger does not neglect his mission. Then he checks on both of them to make sure his wishes have been fulfilled. He takes nothing for granted where caution provides a way to ensure his success.
 
 There is no such thing as over-caution. The majority of people creates more disasters by the total lack of caution than by over-caution. Although It is important to not mistake fear for caution. 
 
 Caution may be used most advantageously In the selection of one's associates and in one's method of relating oneself to  associates. 
 
 The reason for this is obvious. The associates constitute the most important part of one's environment. And environmental influences determine whether one forms the habit of drifting or becomes a non drifter.
 
	 The person  who exercises caution in choice of associates never allows himself to be with any person who does not bring to him through the association, some definite mental spiritual or economic benefit. 
	 
This is sensible and leads to self-determination. It is the desire of every normal person to find material success and happiness. 

Nothing  contributes more to one's success and happiness than carefully chosen associates. Caution in the selection of associates becomes therefore the duty of every person who wishes to become happy and successful. 

The non-drifter carefully selects his associates and allows no one to become closely associated with him unless that person contributes some form of helpful influence, or bestows some definite benefit. 

Caution on the selection of friends has such a definite a bearing on one's success or failure.
